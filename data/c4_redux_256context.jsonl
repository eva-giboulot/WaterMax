In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S", "baseline": ". Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.\nIBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.\n\"For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice\u2014you either run 32-bit or 64-bit\u2014Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,\" Turek said. \"Its an attractive proposition.\"\nAMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.\nWith the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.\nOn Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.\n/zimages/3/28571.gifRead \"MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade.\"\nGordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.\n\"Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,\" said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. \"Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for.\"\nWhile backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.\nTurek agreed. \"The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,\" he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.\n\"Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,\" he said.\nThe Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.\nAlso included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.\nIn the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science & Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry."}

{"prompt": "An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too.\nThe France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the WHO, put processed meats on the top of their \u201cthings that cause cancer list\u201d, grouping them alongside tobacco, asbestos and diesel fumes, for which there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of cancer links.\nAlong the years, there have been many studies that linked processed and red meats with cancer (especially bowel cancer), but there were always some doubts floating about. Now, the 22-member panel analyzed animal experiments, studies of human diet and health, and cell mechanisms that could lead from these meats to cancer.\n\u201cThese findings further support current public health recommendations to limit intake of meat,\u201d Dr. Christopher Wild, who directs IARC, said in a statement.\nThe decision wasn\u2019t unanimous though, and a \u201cprobably\u201d still crept in to the report. Many studies show the links, both in populations of people", "baseline": "and in tests that show how eating these foods can cause cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in its report, released in the Lancet medical journal.\nThis could give you cancer. Photo by Niklas Rhose.\nMost reports on the links between meat and cancer have been softened with some element of doubt, but the IARC uses clear and direct language in saying processed meat causes cancer. There are no phrases such as \u201cmay cause\u201d in the report.\n\u201cOverall, the Working Group classified consumption of processed meat as \u2018carcinogenic to humans\u2019 on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAdditionally, a positive association with the consumption of processed meat was found for stomach cancer. The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as \u2018probably carcinogenic to humans\u2019,\u201d it added.\n\u201cThe experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,\u201d the IARC said. \u201cFor an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\u201d said IARC\u2019s Dr. Kurt Straif.\n\u201cRed meat refers to unprocessed mammalian muscle meat\u2014for example, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, or goat meat\u2014including minced or frozen meat; it is usually consumed cooked,\u201d the IARC said in its report.\nRed meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate. But while processed meat seems to be decidedly bad for your health, not everybody is convinced about red meat.\nThe $95 billion U.S. beef industry has been preparing a retaliation for months, and they\u2019ve been rallying numerous scientists to their cause \u2013 even some unafililiated with the meat industry.\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t think the evidence support any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer,\u201d said Shalene McNeill, executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.\nFor now, the takeaway seems to be this: you need to stop eating processed meat. They have a number of damaging effects, including elevating stroke risk, raising cholesterol and, of course \u2013 cancer. If you absolutely can\u2019t give it up, then reduce it. Quantity does matter, and less is, while not ideal, better than more. The same goes for red meat \u2013 if you must have it, don\u2019t have it every day.

{"prompt": "Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can\u2019t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It\u2019s not about that.\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\nWhat are", "baseline": "the first things you will tackle?\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: \u2018We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.\u2019 It is a huge task.\nWho do you listen to?\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa \u2013 Senegalese and Congolese music \u2013 and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba\u2019s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It\u2019s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can\u2019t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\nI\u2019m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\nBut other people have their own views.\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can\u2019t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs \u2013 our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging."}

The New York Times now even has a section at the bottom of its app called \u201cIn Case You Missed It\u201d with articles from previous days.\nWhile the extended phrase has been used in conversation for a long time, the shorthand betrays an anxiety central to the Internet epoch. There is simply too much readable, viewable and listenable data for anyone to stay abreast of, as a humor piece, \u201cI\u2019m All Caught Up!\u201d by Nick Mickowski in McSweeney\u2019s, playfully suggested.\nWe used to receive media cyclically. Newspapers were published once (or sometimes twice) a day, magazines weekly or monthly. Nightly news was broadcast, well, each night. Television programs", "baseline": "were broadcast on one of the major networks one night a week at a specific time, never to return until a rerun or syndication. Movies were shown first in theaters and on video much later (or, before the advent of VCRs, not until a revival). There were not many interstices, just discrete units \u2014 and a smaller number of them.\nNow we\u2019re in the midst of the streaming era, when the news industry distributes material on a 24-hour cycle, entire seasons of TV shows are dumped on viewers instantaneously, most movies are available at any time and the flow of the Internet and social media is ceaseless. We are nearly all interstitial space, with comparatively few singularities.\nThe cumulative effect is overwhelming for both producers of content and its consumers. Those who put out work, understandably, want to make sure it\u2019s not lost on whatever site is hosting it, let alone in the social media blizzard of \u201cmust read\u201d links, one-off jokes and other self-promotion. When the home page of a website refreshes every couple of hours (or minutes), there aren\u2019t a lot of conspicuous ways to showcase older material except through the referrals of Twitter, Facebook and the like.\nPre-Internet, we accepted that media had a mayfly\u2019s life span: Yesterday\u2019s news was yesterday\u2019s news, and that was it. If you were the creator of it, you made peace with the notion that people either saw it or didn\u2019t when it appeared, and you moved on; there was no alternative.\nIf it lingered in the public consciousness, it was because of its durability, not repeated reminders. Content had finite endings and deaths, not asymptotic approaches and long-term vegetative states from which resuscitation is always an option.\nNow, with just about every airing of a much greater number of shows obtainable at any moment, there is no excuse for missing one \u2014 and, therefore, a more urgent compulsion to catch up, in case you missed it.\nToday, both the outlets and the individuals who are responsible for the work are aware that they have a limited window in which their content can go viral and outlive its short stay on a home page. When it fails to do so, as, by definition, almost everything must, it may seem to them like a disheartening screen-age Zen koan: If an article about deforestation is published but no one clicks on it, did it actually exist?\nHence ICYMI. In an earlier time, the full verbal formulation meant that the recipient was supposed to see something of a certain degree of importance (a note, an email), and the sender was gently reminding you of its oversight.\nNow, the very shortening of the phrase is a byproduct and acknowledgment of the velocity of information against which its attached link is racing. The implication is that you probably have not seen it, and it\u2019s not necessary to your existence, but the sender would like to bring it to your attention anyway, please. It serves as a call of desperation as much as an announcement: Can you hear my whisper in these howling winds? In fact, ICYMI is often used as the second or third attempt to link to something (which suggests the content is not taking off organically) as a means of excusing the repetitive promotion.\nEven the Twitter account for President Obama, one of the few people who can assume that his actions are never missed by the world, occasionally uses ICYMI, especially to highlight achievements the White House may think are undervalued by the public, such as job growth and the Affordable Care Act.\nElissa Strauss, a columnist for TheWeek.com and a freelancer for a number of other Web publications, said that a financial incentive also drives Internet content creators who post their work multiple times (she said she typically \u201ctriple tweets\u201d each of her articles).\nGiven the near-infinite accessibility of digital media, it suggests that what Walter Benjamin called the unique, mystical \u201caura\u201d of an object of art in his seminal 1936 essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d greatly diminished by the reproductive technologies of his time, is completely eradicated by ours.\nLive performances may be the last place to locate any sense of aura. Mr. Benjamin saw various reasons for optimism in the diminution of the aura. Reproduction, he posited, could emancipate us from cultlike reverence toward art and make us keener, more politicized critics. But nowadays it\u2019s pass\u00e9 to note that, during live events, people are often staring into their reproduction-friendly phones, perhaps a redirected form of ritual obeisance.\nAt least they can probably find a video or photo (maybe one they shot themselves) of what they were at later, in case they missed it.\nComing Soon: Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup lifestyle news from the Style, Travel, Food and Home sections delivered to your inbox."}

Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.\nWhile recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.\nThese foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.\nProbiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.\nProbiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.\nLiquids are also vital to recovery.

{"prompt": "Record low and negative interest rates in developed economies are fueling a ravenous search for yield that is forcing pension funds and other conservative institutional investors out of their comfort zones and into risky emerging markets, according to fund managers and analysts.\nThe reason for this has little to do with the attractiveness of EM investments. On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM deb", "baseline": "t by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield takes place behind the scenes, but it is not restricted to developed markets, where an estimated $1.7 trillion in bonds were offering negative yields last month. South Korea's state-run National Pension Service (NPS) announced this week that it would pour more than $40 billion into overseas equities and bonds over the next five years.\nThe NPS, which manages $483 billion and is the biggest investor in the Seoul market, had \"no choice\" but to look abroad for returns, according to the Korea Times, because domestic interest rates are low and set to fall further.\nPaolo Batori, global head of EM fixed income strategy at Morgan Stanley, foresees a fundamental shift in market dynamics. He said about 5 percent, or $80 billion, invested by insurance companies and pension funds in European government bonds would be switched into EM fixed income. Such an increase would roughly double the current exposure of such companies to emerging markets.\nMr. Batori uses the experience of Japanese life insurance companies after Japanese government bond yields declined in the aftermath of the financial crisis to reinforce his forecast. From the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of last year, Japanese life insurance companies increased their investments in foreign assets from just over 15 trillion yen to nearly 35 trillion yen as their search for yield intensified.\nBut where in EM should yield refugees from Europe go? In one sense, there is plenty of potential; emerging market countries account for around 40 percent of global GDP but only 14 percent of the global government bond market by value. And differences in yield are stark.\n\"In aggregate, (local currency emerging market debt) yields 6.5 percent \u2014 just above the average for the last five years, and a full 1.25 percentage points above the level preceding the May 2013 taper tantrum,\" said Denise Prime, an investment manager at GAM.\n\"With former safe havens looking so unappealing, local-currency emerging market debt is an attractive option for fixed-income investors,\" she added.\nBut, of course, yields such as these do not come without risk. One of the biggest concerns is that when the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy \u2014 though the timing for this is uncertain \u2014 funds could exit EM assets in favor of enhanced returns in the U.S.\nThe most vulnerable EM countries in such a scenario would be those that run hefty current account deficits and are therefore reliant on external financing. Such risks have been so well telegraphed that fund managers generally pursue a highly selective approach to EM assets.\nOne of the strategies deployed by investors to mitigate the risks of a strong dollar is to fund investments not by borrowing U.S. dollars but euro, which has depreciated or stayed steady against many EM currencies. In 2014, local EM currency bonds returned an average 7 percent against the euro and have returned 7.3 percent this year so far, according to Ms. Prime.\nIn a separate category, a large but relatively untapped opportunity lies in China. Some $1.5 trillion of the $4 trillion global market for EM local currency bonds is located within China's domestic market, accessible to foreign investors only through a tightly controlled quota system.\nBut for those investors able to access allocations, the returns can be attractive because of the higher interest rate environment in mainland China. The China Universal Enhanced Bond Fund, for example, returned 13.12 percent in 2014, according to China Universal, a Chinese asset manager.\n\"We are definitely seeing increasing interest from European investors, both retail and institutional, who are hunting for yield in a world that is not really delivering their return targets,\" said Christopher Gunns, a managing director at China Universal.\nBut, he notes that Chinese domestic debt stretches the comfort zone for some European investors. \"Among the institutional investors there are two things at play; a conservative risk budget competing with a need to generate returns.\""}

{"prompt": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic lawmakers must soon decide whether President Barack Obama is leading them toward statesmanlike courage or political folly.\nObama used his first State of the Union speech Wednesday to push nervous Democrats to forge ahead on health care, despite voters' worries and opposition from newly strengthened Republicans. Sharpening his focus on the economy, he offered a hodgepodge of tax breaks and other incentives to create new jobs.\nFor Republicans, Obama blended a mix of overtures and digs. But he mainly addressed fellow Democrats, who still can enact his agenda if they overcome fears fueled by events such as last week's stunning GOP victory in the Massachusetts Senate race.\nThat setback may have cost Democrats their filibuster-proof Senate majority, Obama said, but \"we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills.\"\nHe accepted partial blame for the deep troubles facing his health care push, but he implored lawmakers to finish the task rather than yield to public opposition.\n\"", "baseline": "The longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,\" Obama told the joint session of Congress and a nationwide TV audience. But health care problems will continue for millions, he said, and \"I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\"\nHouse and Senate Democratic leaders are scrambling to see if they can salvage the ambitious health care package, which Republicans almost universally oppose. Obama's pep talk was a call to arms, but he offered no new strategies for overcoming the steep parliamentary and political hurdles they face.\nThe president devoted most of his 65-minute speech to job-creation proposals, such as eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investment and extending tax breaks for businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. But those proposals also face uncertainty in Congress, where Senate Democrats say they may need a selective, piecemeal approach to win enough votes.\nObama said Republicans share a responsibility for governing, and he proposed meeting with their House and Senate leaders monthly. But his olive branch seemed brittle at times.\nWithout naming George W. Bush, he pointedly noted that the previous administration left him a big deficit and a deeply troubled economy. For good measure, Obama said the United States killed more al-Qaida terrorists in 2009 than in 2008.\nObama rebuked the Supreme Court for a recent decision that \"reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests\" and foreign corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. At that, conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito made a dismissive face, shook his head in disagreement and seemed to mouth the words \"not true\" as the president spoke.\nRepublicans in the House chamber generally greeted such remarks with stony gazes and smirks. The statements they issued as soon as Obama finished \u2014 or even before he finished, in some cases \u2014 were equally icy.\n\"We had hoped to hear a new commitment to keep his promises to govern from the center, change the tone in Washington, and work with both parties in a bipartisan way to help small businesses create jobs and get our economy moving again,\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. \"Unfortunately, the president and the Democrats in charge of Congress still aren't listening to the American people.\"\nVice President Joe Biden, appearing in an interview Thursday morning on NBC's \"Today\" show, described Obama as upset with the way his program has been handled in Congress.\n\"One of the things that's most frustrating to him,\" Biden said, \"is the obstructionist ways of the United States Senate, on the part of the Republicans, requiring 60 votes, a supermajority, for virtually every single, solitary initiative we've had. Now that we have 59 votes, it's time for everybody to start taking responsibility.\"\nObama has the luxury of waiting until 2012 to seek re-election, while all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs this November. Some Democrats most nervous about the election are urging the administration to slow down, especially on the health care issue that has dominated Congress's attention for months.\nObama gave them no comfort. \"Change has not come fast enough\" for millions of Americans, he said. \"We must answer history's call.\"\nAt the same time, however, the president tried to give Democrats some political cover on other sensitive issues, such as the bank bailouts that angered many voters.\n\"We all hated the bank bailout,\" he said. \"I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\"\nThe president also tried to chip away at GOP talking points.\n\"Let me repeat, we cut taxes,\" he said, citing his administration's tax cuts \"for 95 percent of working families.\"\nRepublicans are quick to note that the deficit has soared during Obama's year in office, and proposals such as the health care overhaul would impose new taxes on high-end medical insurance policies, among other things.\nIn their post-speech commentaries, several Democrats ignored nearly all of Obama's remarks except those aimed at creating jobs, the biggest issue on voters' minds.\n\"His focus was right where it belongs: on jobs and the economy, and on reforming the financial sector,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. \"He acknowledged his own mistakes, and he avoided pointing partisan fingers.\"\nMichael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was less charitable.\nIf Obama is serious about improving the economy, Steele said, \"he will give Republicans a seat at the table.

{"prompt": "'When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered,' Kanye West's DJ says of getting the drummer's call.\nIt's been nearly a year since Travis Barker performed with a DJ, but now, he's getting ready to hit the road again, this time with Kanye West's main man behind the decks.\nBarker will be teaming up with turntablist A-Trak \u2014 West's touring DJ \u2014 for a run of shows, scheduled to kick off March 9-10 at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre. The gigs will mark the first time he's performed live with a DJ since the death of his partner DJ AM in August. But, as Barker told MTV News earlier this month, he had always considered working with Trak on a project of some sort. And after the two jammed a bit last year, both men knew they had to take their show to the stage.\n\"I had met A-Trak last year at Coachella, but I had seen a set of his at Avalon in Los Angeles maybe four years ago, with AM,\" Barker told MTV News", "baseline": ". \"He was a guy who I always wanted to work with in some way.

It was very fluid. And we stopped and looked at the watch, and it was like, 'Oh, we've been playing for an hour and didn't even realize it.'

{"prompt": "Lynn Blake, left, teaches two hospital employees CPR at the VVMC Safety Fair. Blake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion for educating Eagle County residents came from her own Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which a bystander provided CPR and saved her life. She was just 27 at the time.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day 2007, Lynn Blake was embarking on a new job in Vail Village when she had a rude awakening. The 27-year-old suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately for her, someone trained in CPR stepped forward and kept her heart beating until emergency personnel arrived with a defibrillator. If someone dropped in front of you unconscious, with no notable pulse, would you know what to do? Some 325,000 people die every year of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States. And, contrary to popular belief, it strikes people of all ages. \u201cI did not know a thing about cardiac arrest. I didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Blake said. Now she knows firsthand about sudden cardiac", "baseline": "arrest. The more she found out, the more she wondered why more people weren\u2019t educated about SCA, the leading causes of death in the U.S. Just a few months after Blake\u2019s sudden cardiac arrest, area pro biker Mike Janelle, in the prime of his life, died of SCA.\u201dIt\u2019s a lot more common than people realize,\u201d Blake said. Yet, she found, \u201cno one\u2019s really educating people about cardiac arrest.\u201d That\u2019s why she founded the Starting Hearts Foundation, partnering with the Vail Valley Medical Center and area emergency services. Starting Hearts is a non-profit dedicated to saving the lives of SCA victims, through communitywide CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillation) education and access. \u201cVail Valley Medical Center embraces Lynn\u2019s mission,\u201d said Doris Kirchner, CEO and president of Vail Valley Medical Center. \u201cVVMC is in the business of saving lives, and Starting Hearts can have a direct impact on that mission by engaging the community to help recognize and react to SCA appropriately.\u201d Community key to saving lives Nearly 60 percent of cardiac arrests are witnessed. Most people know to call 911. But if that\u2019s all you know about saving someone from SCA, the victim\u2019s chance of surviving is slim. It is estimated 95 percent of cardiac arrest victims die before reaching a hospital if they do not receive shock treatment, such as from a defibrillator. That is why the response of bystanders is so critical to saving lives. Yet, Blake found the vast majority of people aren\u2019t trained in CPR or using an AED. CPR classes tend to be taken only by those in jobs that demand the skill. Even if a layperson struggles to find a nearby course, it is difficult, Blake explains. Finding an AED is no easy task either. To address these issues, Starting Hearts acquired a decommissioned bus, and created the HeartRod, a mobile CPR/AED training unit, sponsored by Vail Valley Medical Center. Now, Blake, a certified instructor, travels to community events, Eagle County Schools and businesses teaching CPR and AED classes. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to come to me; I need to be able to go to them,\u201d Blake said.Blake also created the event \u201cAll You Need is Heart,\u201d which will take place on Feb. 14 at The Sebastian in Vail. The event focuses on personal heart health, including more than $1,200 worth of heart screens such as EKG\u2019s, ultrasounds and cholesterols test. There are also feature presentations on endurance sports and the affects of high altitude, overcoming life\u2019s challenges and savings lives in Eagle County. The event is $150 per person and is a fundraiser for Starting Hearts Foundation. Save more livesStarting Hearts will launch the ambitious \u201cSave More Lives\u201d campaign. \u201cOur goal is to annually educate 25,000 people in Eagle County,\u201d in CPR and AED, Blake said. As part of the campaign, Blake decided to apply the type of lessons every child has grasped. \u201cIf you ask anyone what to do if they catch on fire, they\u2019d respond, \u2018stop, drop and roll.\u2019 Starting Hearts came up with a similar unforgettable message for SCA: \u2018Call, push and shock.'\u201d Dr. Lawrence Gaul is the Starting Hearts medical director. He was the cardiologist who treated Blake when she came into the Vail Valley Medical Center during her cardiac arrest episode. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Gaul said, explaining Call, push and shock. \u201cCall 911. Do rapid compressions in the middle of the chest and shock the person. When someone has a cardiac arrest the most important thing needed is shock.\u201d That\u2019s why, over the next year, the Save More Lives campaign will focus during on placing portable AEDs in strategic public places around Eagle County so anyone can find the nearest AED in emergencies.When Dr. Gaul traveled to Monaco for a medical conference, he was surprised to see this tiny country filled with street signs everywhere pointing to the nearest AED. By 2015, when the World Cup arrives in the Vail Valley, Dr. Gaul and Starting Hearts hope to have AEDs similarly available.To Blake, it is most rewarding when someone comes and tells her one of the classes she taught made a difference. There was the lady who took her class and was able to remove an object stuck in the throat of her choking grandchild through CPR. And the little girl who took one of her courses through the Youth Foundation and went home and practiced CPR with her family. \u201cI encourage everyone in this community to get involved and participate in the Save More Lives campaign,\u201d Blake said. \u201cIf everyone gets involved, we really can do it.\u201dTo participate in Save More Lives, find out about CPR and AED classes or to donate, contact Starting Hearts by emailing lynn@startinghearts.org or calling 970-331-3983."}

{"prompt": "Why are American women dying in childbirth?\nMaternal mortality rates are falling in every industrialised nation - except for the United States.\nThe United States is not the first place that springs to mind when considering women dying in childbirth. So the fact that two American women die of pregnancy-related causes every day may come as a surprise.\nAccording to the World Bank, The US ranks 50th in maternal mortality globally - falling behind every other industrialised nation. A woman in the US is as likely to suffer a maternal death as a woman in sanctions-hit Iran, and four times as likely as a woman in Germany.\n\"It is a preventable health issue,\" said Amnesty International's Rachel Ward. \"It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We\u2019re waiting for political will.\"\nWhat's worse is that US maternal mortality rates may actually be on the rise. Eugene Declercq, of Boston University's School of Public Health, produced a short film named Birth by the numbers, discussing maternal mortality in the US. In a 2013 follow-", "baseline": "up report, he noted how mortality rates in other industrialised nations had declined - but in the US, it increased by 30 percent in the first decade of the new millennium.\nAnother 2013 report, this one by Truven Health Analytics, says the US spends more than any other country on costs associated with maternal healthcare. So why are American mothers still dying of pregnancy related deaths?\nThe answer is complex and belies simple solutions.\n\"There is sadly no magic bullet that explains what is behind the high levels of maternal mortality in the United States,\" Amnesty's Rachel Ward said. \"It's a combination of factors that speak to the systemic problems of failing to provide affordable, accessible, quality health services to all women in the United States.\"\nOne of these factors is likely the demographics of new mothers in the US.\n\"Our women are older. Our main maternal age has risen,\" said Dr Sarah Kilpatrick of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"We have a lot more women in their late 30s and 40s, when you have a higher chance of having other health issues such as cardiac disease.\" Obesity is also on the rise in the country, which also increases the chances of birthing complications.\nMany believe that the US healthcare system is in crisis. The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 47 million non-elderly US residents had no health insurance in 2012.\nUninsured pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid. But, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they receive fewer prenatal care services, are more likely to enter pregnancy with health problems, and are more likely to have adverse maternal health outcomes.\nIt is a preventable health issue. It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We\u2019re waiting for political will.\nPoor women and women of colour are by far the hardest hit by this crisis. In 2012, 23 percent of African-American women and 36 percent of Hispanic women had no health insurance.\nA 2013 report by the New York Women's Foundation found that black women in New York City had a maternal mortality rate of 79 deaths per 100,000 live births - compared with 10 per 100,000 live births for white women. That means black women in New York have worse maternal mortality rates than women in either Syria or Iraq.\nThose numbers reflect a trend also cited in an Amnesty International 2011 follow up to its report, Deadly Delivery, which found that women in low-income areas were twice as likely to die a maternal death than women in high-income areas, and black women were four times as likely as white women to die while giving birth to a child.\nOpen Arms Perinatal Services in Seattle is one organisation trying to fill the gaps women are slipping through. Open Arms provides doula care, non-medical social and emotional support to low-income mothers.\n\"When Martin Luther King Jr was born, his mother did not have access to the local hospital because she was black, so we have this history of separating care,\" Open Arms Executive Director Sheila Capestany told Al Jazeera. \"So you build things into your systems that are really hard to undo, and you have to undo them intentionally, you can't just expect they're going to go away.\"\nShe believes that these community-based solutions are a crucial part of undoing the historical injustices that continue to resonate today.\nFocusing only on access to care obscures a more fundamental problem - whether that care is of a decent quality, even for those who can afford it.\nWhite women, the demographic most likely to have positive birth outcomes, and more likely to have health insurance, still have worse indicators than their counterparts in 24 other industrialised countries.\nIn the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem.\nIn almost every other industrialised nation, comprehensive maternal healthcare is inexpensive or even free. In Britain, midwives usually visit mothers at home two weeks after birth. In the Netherlands, more than 16 percent of births occur at home under the care of a midwife and are covered by insurance. In France, coverage includes a week's stay in the hospital, during which women also receive training in caring for her newborn.\nMost US insurance companies cover only what is considered medically necessary - and that usually means discharging women a day or two after birth with a single post-natal check-up six weeks after delivery. Ward, the managing director of Amnesty International's US programme told Al Jazeera this six weeks is a critical time period.\n\"Tameka McFarquhar, she was 22, she bled to death in her apartment in New York after giving birth,\" Ward said of one of the women featured in her research. \"She was alone, a home visit could have saved her life.\"\nAny area of neglect represents risks to maternal health, but with the right research and investment applied, such problems present opportunities to those working to reverse the numbers.\n\"Maternal death is not solved yet, but I think we\u2019re making huge strides to reduce it,\" said Kilpatrick, the chair of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Cedars-Sinai.\nUS President Barack Obama's signature healthcare programme, the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have tried to change or repeal a number of times, aims to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes this could decrease the chances that women may become pregnant while already having potentially life threatening health problems.\nOne low-cost solution is the increased use of midwives. The majority of births around the world are attended to by midwives. In Britain, that includes 57 percent of births.\nStateside, fewer than eight percent of births are assisted by midwives. Most births are attended to by doctors, part of what makes maternal healthcare in the US so expensive.\n\"In the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem,\u201d said Boston University's Declercq.\nThe problem is financial but it also may be medical. The rate of caesarean sections in the US is more than 30 percent - more than double the World Health Organisation's recommendation.\nExposing mothers to interventions such as caesarean sections when they are not necessary also exposes them to potential risks, say experts.\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recently released guidelines recommending that unnecessary caesarean sections should be reduced.\n\"In my mind, there is no doubt that our C-section rate is too high in the United States,\" said Kilpatrick of Cedars-Sinai. \"The good news is that it has plateaued. It's been the same for two to three years now.\"\nAmid the variety of medical and governmental changes that are being made, Capestany from Open Arms believes that there is also a basic social change that needs to be made in the way Americans understand childbirth.\n\"It's not intuitive in the United States that, in fact, childbirth is more than just a medical event. It is a physical event that requires medical attention, social attention, and emotional attention,\" Capestany told Al Jazeera.\n\"Until we acknowledge that, we're not going to be able to get the best care.\""}

Then they took a closer look under the hood to discover that none of these carts has the same design. \u201cEach one is made artisanally in Queens and Brooklyn, at what we call chop shops,\u201d Dubrovsky says. \u201cEach one has different compartments, the plumbing is not up to code, so by the time you rip all that out, all of a sudden you\u2019ve put liability on yourself.\u201d So MOVE had to scrap the magpie carts and start from scratch.\nOne hundred of the first carts will be funded by MOVE and reserved for disabled veterans, and the remaining 400 will go to vendors who sign up\u2014at no cost to them, because the pilot program will be sponsored. (MOVE says they are still reviewing sponsors and advertisers and have yet to make a selection.) Vendors will still have to shoulder the costs of the compressed natural gas fuel (but not Internet connectivity), but Energy Vision\u2019s report also suggests that running a food cart on grid power could save $5,200 a year in energy charges."}

{"prompt": "WHEN predicting which planets beyond Earth could support life, astronomers usually follow the water. Exoplanets with rocky surfaces are declared habitable if they orbit far enough from their star to potentially host oceans.\nBut as our planetary collection grows, and telescopes for studying them improve, some astrobiologists say it is time to narrow the hunt. Christopher McKay at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California has come up with an expanded \u201cchecklist\u201d for habitability, which also considers factors like a planet\u2019s light levels, radiation exposure and atmospheric composition (PNAS, DOI&colon; 10.1073/pnas.1304212111).\nSome items can be inferred just from knowing a planet\u2019s probable composition and distance from its host star.

{"prompt": "Mattel's Future: Happily Ever After?\nMattel has a plan for the rest of the year, but it seems to be playing a shorter game.\nAccording to its most recent earnings release, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) seems to have become a victim of its own success. The company reported a 12% drop in revenue from its Barbie brand, while other girls' toys ate up market share. The American Girl and Monster High lines did particularly well, but the cost was high. As the newer lines continue to succeed, the questions around Barbie's future grow.\nMonster High is leading the way at Mattel, and analysts now believe that the business may be worth up to $500 million annually. That success has helped steer Mattel toward new opportunities, including a variation on Monster High -- which is a line of monsters in high school -- called Ever After High. The new line is going to hit stores in the second half of the year, and focuses on classic fairytale characters while they're in high school.\nWhen I say \"classic fairytale characters,\" I, of course", "baseline": ", mean slightly rebranded Disney (NYSE:DIS) princesses. The list includes Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella-style characters, along with some princes, and Alice-in-Wonderland themed dolls.\nThe move makes an incredible amount of sense for Mattel, as Disney has had runaway success with its rebranding of the princesses as a separate line. According to analyst studies, the Princess line is generating $3 billion in annual global sales. That's six times what Monster High is pulling in, and highlights the value available in the marketplace. Since Mattel is only spending $10 million to $20 million to develop the spin-off lines , the payback is almost immediate.\nThe stock suffered a 7% drop yesterday in light of the shortfall from Mattel. Overall, the company managed a 1% increase in global sales, but it had a 25% drop in earnings per share . The long game for Mattel looks increasingly like an ever evolving line of girls' toys. While the company has had success with boys' lines, its real core lies in girls.\nOn the competitive side, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) seems to have boys' toys locked down. The company is generating more than twice as much from its boys' toys as it does from girls' toys. That success is resting on the strength of Marvel-branded toys, G.I Joe, and NERF. Mattel is a much larger company, and Hasbro has to be content to simply succeed where it can.\nFor Mattel, the most interesting thing to come over the next year may be the conflict that arises between Mattel and Disney, if its Ever After brand takes off. Right now, Mattel produces a number of toys with the Disney branding, and it relies on a good relationship with the media company. Disney may start to see some encroachment on its territory, which could lead to a confrontation. But first, Ever After has to succeed."}
{"prompt": "Most gardeners think of diascias as low-growing bedding plants suited to a summer container or the front of a sunny border.\nHowever Diascia personata breaks the mould and produces stiff stems that grow 3ft tall. The substantial bright green foliage supports dusky pink flowers and these appear in profusion from early May to November.\nHandsome, upright and show-stopping, it first came to my attention when Fergus Garrett of Great Dixter in East Sussex brought it to a Perennial Plant Day at RHS Wisley in June last year.\nHaving never seen it before I then spotted it two days later on a Hopleys' stand (see details below) and snapped it up.\nAlthough the form I acquired was labelled 'Hopleys', it is the same plant grown at Great Dixter.\nDiascias are found on the eastern side of southern Africa. There are 70 species in all and most are annual, but there are a few perennials.\nThey are members of the Scrophularia or figwort family, together with verbascum and buddle", "baseline": "ia, although the whole tribe has recently been reclassified.\nThe common name of diascia is \"twinspur\" and this refers to two spurs found at the back of the flower. The closely related genera Alonsoa and Nemesia look similar, but have more spurs - often these are longer.\nAlthough diascias flower for months in Britain they have a much shorter flowering season in their native land because they are pollinated by a different species of bee: Bees from the genus Rediviva (native to southern Africa) have extra long forelegs, and this allows them to reach the spurs of the flowers in order to collect a fatty oil produced by the glands.\nThe legs of the bee soak up the oil, rather like a sponge, and pollen is transferred to the body of the bee during this process. The flowers are then pollinated and fade. Our native bees have shorter legs and so fail to pollinate the flowers.\nIn the wild, different species of diascia growing together evolve and produce stamens of varying lengths, or in varying positions, so that any pollen deposited sticks to different parts of the bee's body.\nThis system prevents cross-pollination. But if the necessary species of bee is absent, the flowers are not pollinated, so flower longer.\nThe late plant breeder and hobbyist, Hector Harrison, of Appleby, in South Humberside, found out about diascia's pollination needs and began hand-pollinating three species about 1978. His first hybrids flowered in the mid-Eighties and he generously gave them to nurseries and enthusiasts.\nHarrison hybrids include 'Appleby Apricot', 'Iceberg', 'Salmon Supreme' and 'Lilac Belle'. White, lilac, various pinks and apricot diascias are all available.\nSome of these hybrids may be sterile even if they encounter the long-legged bees required for pollination: sterility often occurs when two closely related species hybridise.\nHarrison was, however, unaware of the first British-raised diascia. The late John Kelly, once curator at Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens, applied the pollen from D. cordata to D. barberae. He grew nine seeds and named the best red-pink 'Ruby Field' after a lady who sometimes worked on the nursery.\nIt is now listed under D. barberae in the RHS Plant Finder so may not even be a hybrid. The diascia gene pool was further expanded when new species were collected in the Seventies for the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.\nDiascia personata is a perennial from the Eastern Cape and hardier than the annual forms. It will survive most winters given a sunny position and well-drained soil.\nIts hardiness equates roughly to the dahlia in my opinion and \"insurance\" cuttings should be taken in early summer, in case of a hard winter.\nSometimes another plant, the similarly upright D. rigescens, is mistaken for D. personata and the flowers are a similar colour.\nThey are, however, significantly different: D. rigescens is shorter, between 1-2ft and the foliage a duller blue-green. It has less stature. I have successfully over wintered both of these, but last winter saw them off.\nDiascias are sun-loving plants, but enjoy fertile rather than dry, poor soil. The cushion-forming types can get straggly so cut them back in late April and late August to keep them compact.\nHardiness can be a problem, but many will survive winter in well-drained soil.\nCuttings can be taken between May and September. However, if you want to keep cuttings through the winter take them in the first half of summer so that a good root system is developed.\nLook for new growth that has started to harden slightly, preferably without flower buds. Cut off just below the node (the bumpy part where leaves are attached) so that your cutting measures roughly 4in long. Trim the cutting just below the bumpy node and strip any lower leaves.\nPlunge into a suitable rooting matter. This could be a mixture of compost and horticultural sand. I prefill small seed trays with damp horticultural sand and plunge cuttings in as I take them. No rooting compost or special equipment is needed.\nYou can containerise Diascia personata, but it has to be a substantial pot to balance the height of the plant. The ruby-pink flowers are excellent with dark blue agapanthus, purple dahlias or fluffy pennisetums.\nAt Great Dixter they use D. personata with the green and cream vertically striped grass, Miscanthus sinensis var. condensatus 'Cosmopolitan' to great effect. Graham Gough, of Marchants Plants, also uses it in his grass-led garden and he describes it as \"remarkable and lofty\"."}

Because it was subject only to rather minor bombing, Prague\u2019s charm and beauty were nearly unscathed by World War II.\nBut 45 years of socialist \u201ccompassion\u201d under a Soviet Union puppet regime had turned everything soot gray and ugly before eastern and central Europe was liberated in 1989.\nWhen I arrived, you could walk down the winding cobblestone streets of the Old Town near its famous castle amid five-story ancient residential buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder against narrow sidewalks on both sides. Buildings that had once been vibrant with color, exquisite in their features and soaring to the sky were now so", "baseline": "ot-gray dingy, decaying and seemingly drooping in shame.\nThen, out of nowhere, came one that was a brilliant pastel lime-green, fully restored and bursting with light and life. Then soot-gray, soot-gray and suddenly another one, bright pink, restored to its original glory. Soot-gray, soot-gray, soot-gray. And another beauty reclaimed in rich mustard yellow.\nAnd then, across the street, amid more weeping soot-gray ghosts, a sight that explained everything: One of the old wrecks with its entire face covered with \u2026 scaffolding. The secret of a second Prague Spring was revealed as people liberated from the yoke of coercive collectivism and soaring in restored liberty were scrubbing away the toxic dirt of statist oppression, rebuilding the decorative art that was their heritage, and baptizing it all with lovely color.\nIt was especially moving because in 1968 I had been an ardent fan of the (first) Prague Spring, led by a Czechoslovakian freedom movement that was brutally crushed in the city\u2019s main square by Soviet tank squads.\nThis month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the stunning 1989 collapse of the Soviet and Eastern Block, highlighted by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the liberation of Prague and eastern and central Europe.\nGrowing up in the 1950s with basement bomb shelters, air-raid sirens and duck-and-cover drills in response to threats from that truly Evil Empire created even in children an abiding sense of unease \u2014 an understanding that serious threats were afoot in the world. As the Cold War became normalcy, there was vague despair for three more decades at a world locked in continuing tension due to the menace we thought was permanent because its evil controlled the world\u2019s second most powerful nation and others. With all that exacerbated by the rise of Red China, it seemed like a nightmare that would never end.\nThen, of a sudden, there was light in the world as the Evil Empire simply crumbled, being unable to keep up with the West\u2019s prosperity brought by the renewed commitment to freedom of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and others. The unimaginable happened: The bad guys simply folded and communism collapsed due to its own \u201cinternal contradictions\u201d.\nToday, we face domestic challenges from progressivism, socialism\u2019s close cousin. We face serious international challenges from terrorism, much of it ideological or religion-based and some of it just insane. I don\u2019t minimize these challenges. However, whenever I feel daunted by them, I remember the second Prague Spring and the collapse of something even bigger and worse that we thought would never end, and I\u2019m hopeful.\nRon Knecht is an economist, law-school graduate, higher education regent and Nevada controller-elect."}

{"prompt": "Ukraine has started siphoning off Russian gas bound for European customers. This follows the cutoff of gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1, after the two countries\u2019 gas companies failed to agree on a price for 2009.\nGazprom deputy CEO Aleksandr Medvedev is in Prague to inform the EU about the on-going gas conflict with Ukraine, blaming Ukraine for the reduction in supplies.\nGazprom's board has held an emergency meeting in Moscow where they were discussing Ukraine's siphoning of gas.\n\u201cUkraine has cynically announced it's siphoning off gas from the export pipe. Dispatchers in the Balkans say the region is already suffering from Ukarine's actions. Gazprom believes the Balkan states need to use the Energy Charter signed by Ukraine to protect themselves. This charter says no contract disputes should affect supplies provided by a transit country,\u201d stated Gazprom\u2019s Deputy CEO Aleksandr Medvedev.\nEarlier on Friday the company\u2019s spokesman Sergey Kuriyanov said that Ukraine is avoiding negotiations with Gazprom. He noted that Ukraine\u2019", "baseline": "s Naftogaz has promised to pay $US 1.5 billion by January 11.\n\u201cBut there will still be an outstanding debt of $US 614 million. Therefore, we plan to increase the transit level of gas through Belarus,\u201d Kupriyanov said.\nUkraine, however, has denied it is siphoning off gas from transit pipes.\nAlso, according to Russia\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko, Russia has asked the EU parliament to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue of Russian gas transits via Ukraine.\n\u201cGazprom representatives are ready to head to Brussels, and all European countries, to fully inform them about the dispute between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftogaz,\u201d he said.\nEarlier Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said that independent auditors are being blocked from checking whether gas supplies to Europe are being hindered.\n\u201cWe don't have an effective gas delivery contract with Naftogaz now. Naftogaz is currently obstructing the operators of RosUkrEnergo and is not letting them extract the gas from underground facilities which they have,\u201d said Kupriyanov.\nThere is still no contract signed between the two countries and debts must be paid in full before another can be signed. The Russian energy company has also calculated over $US 600 million in penalties Ukraine owes.\nGazprom\u2019s overall supply reduction amounted to 90 million cubic metres a day, which is roughly Ukraine\u2019s consumption.\nBoth Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko have appealed to Russia not to cut gas supplies to the country and to continue talks. They've also named the price their country is prepared to pay for the gas: $US 201 per 1,000 cubic metres.\nGazprom, though, wanted a higher price \u2013 $US 250 per 1,000 cubic metres \u2013 which is almost half the market price. Ukraine turned down this offer. A statement by Gazprom followed that it would now sell gas to Ukraine at the market price of $US 418.\nAs Europe depends on Russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies, and the fact that 80% of their supplies pass through Ukrainian pipelines, it is watching the ongoing conflict closely.\nAfter Russia had announced a new gas price for Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko said it would be \u201clogical\u201d that transit costs should go up too. The Ukrainian leader said that talks with Russia are to be resumed shortly with the final agreement to be reached by the time of the Orthodox Christmas, January 7.\nA Ukrainian delegation has set off on a tour of Europe, which aims at informing the European Union about the gas situation and to provide guarantees that the gas will be transported across Ukraine as normal. Also, Ukraine's president Yushchenko has sent letters to the leaders of eight countries and to the European Commission to explain his reasons of the gas dispute.\nEarlier Ukraine had threatened to confiscate Russian gas passing through the country, refusing to guarantee supplies to Europe as Russia promises to stop gas supplies to Ukraine due to debts. Gazprom called Ukraine\u2019s reaction \u2018blackmail\u2019.\nAs Gazprom has vowed to maintain supplies to Europe in full, its gas will be entering Ukraine for the foreseeable future, at least until the Nord or South Stream is opened.\nOne major pipeline \u2013 bringing gas to Ukraine \u2013 passes through the town of Kursk, while a larger one \u2013 taking gas to Europe \u2013 operates in Voronezh (see picture).\nMeanwhile, German gas company E.ON Ruhrgas has taken precautions in case supplies of Russian gas are hampered. Its press secretary Helmut Roloff said that the company has agreed on additional gas supplies from Norway in case of emergency. Nevertheless, on Friday, they received all the gas they had ordered."}
{"prompt": "Finland faces heightened risks from links between radical Islam and terrorism, according to a fresh report by Finland\u2019s security and intelligence police unit Supo.

{"prompt": "How it feels when J.K. Rowling gives us more \"Harry Potter\" information.\nJ.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" universe is enormous. And since closing the book on the main series in 2007, she keeps adding to it. There are spinoff books, movies, and a play in the franchise \u2014 many of which reveal new insight about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other characters from the original series.\nThe wealth of \"Harry Potter\" material also means that there's a wealth of behind-the-scenes information that yields new details of how J.K. Rowling thought up the books, how the filmmakers made the movies, and a ton of other information about the \"Harry Potter\" universe. Rowling even launched Pottermore, which has become a sort of ever-evolving encyclopedia of trivia and back-stories from her world.\nIt's a lot to keep up with. But for \"Harry Potter\" fans, all of it is fascinating.\nHarry Potter is rich, because his ancestor was a pharmace", "baseline": "utical tycoon.\nHarry Potter finding out he's loaded in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nOne of the first things Harry does when he finds out he's a wizard way back in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" is visit the Gringotts wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. After all, he'll need some cash to buy school supplies for Hogwarts.\nIn his vault, he finds out that he has piles and piles of gold galleons. Harry's rich! Way more rich than most of his friends. Why? The books don't really explain. But Rowling addressed the issue on Pottermore.\nIn the 12th century, Harry's ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe developed pharmaceutical remedies that were the basis for Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. He built a business out of it, and the Potter family maintained the fortune for generations. Some time later, Harry's grandfather Fleamont Potter \u2014 the son of the \"original\" Harry Potter \u2014 quadrupled the family fortune with hair potion. The hair potion is even advertised in a stray newspaper in \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nGringotts does exchanges between magical and muggle money.\nA Gringotts goblin from \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nAs J.K. Rowling pointed out, it's the only way Muggle-born wizards and witches could buy wands, since Ollivanders only takes galleons, knuts, and sickles \u2014 not pounds or euros.\nThere's one character from the books who existed in real life.\nAn engraved portrait of Nicolas Flamel.\nIn Rowling's series, Nicolas Flamel is the alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone, the magical object at the center of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" that can grant a person immortality.\nIn real life, Flamel was a French scholar and bookseller who lived in the 14th and early 15th centuries. After his death, he got a reputation as an alchemist who secretly achieved immortality. Rowling wrote about the inspiration on Pottermore, where she said Flamel attended the French wizarding school Beauxbatons in her version of his life.\nGreen gloves were used to make the books fly around in the Hogwarts library.\nEmma Watson as Hermione in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\"\nFor the movies \u2014 particularly a scene in \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\"\u2014 the books in the Hogwarts library have a knack for organizing themselves on shelves. The secret behind the magic is that green gloves were used. They worked the same way green screen does, and were wiped away in post-production so it looked like the books floated on their own.\nThere were two Harry Potters.\nThe Mirror of Erised scene in \"Sorcerer's Stone.\"\n\"Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913 - 1921. Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family's exclusion from the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight.'\"\nThe original Harry Potter didn't show up in the books, but he lived around the time of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" So don't rule him out for a surprise appearance in the movie series.\nThe film designers have been hiding a secret character in the movies' fake newspapers.\nWhat does Harry know about the Ginger Witch?\nThe Fourth Estate is an important part of Rowling's universe. The Daily Prophet covers magic in Britain and The New York Ghost covers the same in the United States.\nIn almost every \"Harry Potter\" movie, it was the design firm MinaLima that put together the fake newspaper props for different scenes. They had fun with it. Throughout the series, you can spot stories about \"The Ginger Witch.\" She's a hooligan with a multinational criminal past spanning decades.\n\"We know now that things do get seen,\" designer Miraphora Mina told INSIDER. \"In the past, we didn't realize how much these would be scrutinized by fans.\"\nRead about all of the Ginger Witch's exploits here.\nThere's a perfume company that exists in the background of both the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies.\nDumbledore in front of a Divine Magic poster in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and a poster for the same brand featured in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nAnother one of MinaLima's inventions is the Divine Magic perfume company. We first see it in a poster behind Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" when he meets with Harry at the beginning of the film. In \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" there's a street poster advertising the same brand more than half a century earlier.\nBefore becoming headmaster, Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.\nMichael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore.\nDumbledore is an academic and something of a magical genius. As his chocolate frog card attests, he's \"particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\" So it makes sense that he was a teacher at the wizarding school, not just the administrator.\nIt was while Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher that Tom Riddle \u2014 later to become Lord Voldemort \u2014 attended Hogwarts. He also taught Newt Scamander, the main character in \"Fantastic Beasts,\" with whom he has a close bond. An issue of the publication \"Transfiguration Today\" in the movie has an article featuring his work. Jude Law is slated to play Dumbledore in the forthcoming \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies, which will be about taking down his rival Gellert Grindelwald.\nNewt Scamander was a Hufflepuff.\nScamander's scarf gives it away.\nSpeaking of Newt Scamander and Hogwarts, the character \u2014 played in \"Fantastic Beasts\" by Eddie Redmayne \u2014 was sorted into the Hufflepuff house. You might have spotted his canary-and-black scarf throughout the movie, signaling Hufflepuff's colors.\nJ.K. Rowling wanted \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" to look like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nThe cover of \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\"\n\"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" was a biography written by Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist hell-bent on destroying his reputation. For the movies, Rowling wanted to reflect the poor, salacious quality of the book. So she told MinaLima to make it overwrought like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nMACUSA president Seraphina Picquery has a big throne that looks like Dumbledore's from Hogwarts.\nHer golden throne in \"Fantastic Beasts\" was intentionally made to be a visual reference to Dumbledore's in Hogwarts's Great Hall.\n\"There were props designed to connect the film back to the 'Harry Potter' series,\"supervising modeller Pierre Bohanna wrote in \"Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nColin Farrell didn't read a single page of \"Harry Potter\" before reading J.K. Rowling's script for \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nHe watched the movies, though.\nFarrell told SFX Magazine earlier this year that he was a big fan of the \"Harry Potter\" movies, but he didn't read any of J.K. Rowling's work before reading her script. He wanted to play the role of auror Percival Graves based on that screenplay alone.\nThere's a good reason the Horcrux inside Harry wasn't destroyed in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nHarry getting bitten by the basilisk in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nFor years, \"Harry Potter\" fans wondered what, exactly, was going on with the portion of Voldemort's soul that was inside Harry. When Voldemort tried and failed to kill Harry himself, he ended up inadvertently leaving a Horcrux inside him.\nBut if that's the case, why wasn't it destroyed when the Basilisk in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" bit Harry, just as its poison-infused fang destroyed the horcrux that was in Tom Riddle's diary?\n\"A Horcrux can only be destroyed if its container is damaged beyond repair,\" Rowling explained. \"Harry was healed by Fawkes. Had he died, the Horcrux would indeed have been destroyed.\"\nMany of the spells are derived from Latin roots.\nWhen coming up with magical spells, Rowling clearly worked her studies of Classical language and mythology at the University of Exeter. Many of them are based in the Latin language. \"Accio,\" for example, sounds like \"accerso,\" which means \"to summon or fetch.\" \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" the summoning charm, from from the word \"wing\" (referring to flight); \"ard\" (from the Latin \"aardus,\" which can mean \"elevated\"); and \"levi\" (which means \"to lift\").\nJ.K. Rowling wrote a \"Harry Potter\" prequel short story \u2014 and the original copy was stolen.\nIn 2008, Rowling hand wrote an 800-page story about James and Sirius Potter noodling around on magical motorcycles and escaping some muggle cops. You can read it here. She auctioned it off for charity, but in April of 2017, that handwritten draft was stolen and it hasn't been found to this day.\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has a specific meaning for each of his names.\nYes, that's his full name.\nRowling is famous for her memorable, magical character names. She's put a lot of thought into them, and a lot of the names refer to some deeper meaning for each character. Dumbledore, as the character with the most names, might be the best example.\n\"Albus\" is Latin for \"white,\" which could be symbolic or just refer to his beard. \"Percival\" was one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, who went in search for the lost grail. \"Wulfric\" may be a reference to the 12th-century British figure Wulfric of Haselbury, who was known as a miracle worker. And \"Brian\" is often thought to be derived from an Old Celtic word that roughly means \"noble.\"\n\"Dumbledore\" is one name that Rowling has discussed explicitly. It's an Old English word for \"bumblebee.\"\n\"Because Albus Dumbledore is very fond of music, I always imagined him as sort of humming to himself a lot,\" Rowling said in a 1999 interview.\nSome of the food in the movies was real.\nOne of the highlights of the \"Harry Potter\" movies and books are the feasts in the Hogwarts Great Hall. Shepherd's pie, Yorkshire pudding, and pumpkin juice seem to be served at every meal. During the epic feast scene in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" many of the dishes were actually cooked up for a more realistic effect. In general, the food was fake and made with resin.\nThe glass bottles in Snape's potions classroom was filled with really weird stuff.\nThere's probably gross stuff in there.\nThe movie's set designer found things like tufts of hair and unwanted guts and bones from local butchers for the potion ingredient vials. The room itself also expanded between movies, making room for more extras in later entries in the series.\nFour different owls played Hedwig, Harry's owl, in the movies.\nMore than 12 rats played Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, four cats played Hermione's pet Crookshanks, and nine Neapolitan Mastiffs played Hagrid's dog, Fang.\nMovie producers stood in for the Hogwarts moving portraits.\nThe portraits that line the walls of Hogwarts castle in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando.\nOne of the magical castle's features is that it has paintings that move. Some of them had plot significance, like the Fat Lady in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" who was played by comedian Dawn French. Others, though, were played by the movie's producers, who wanted to immortalize themselves in some way on screen.\n15,000 glass orbs were made for the Room of Prophecy scene in \"Order of the Phoenix.\" None of them were used.\nYou can still see the orbs on the Warner Bros. studio tour in London.\nIn the end, the producers decided to digitize the whole thing and none of the orbs made it to the movies.\nThe Black family tree wasn't canonized until the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie.\nThe Black family is one of the oldest and most important in the wizarding community. There's Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, who's cousins with Voldemort's right-hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange, and there's also Regulus Arcturus Black, who tried to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and Phineas Nigellus Black, a former headmaster of Hogwarts.\nIt's confusing, and the books refer to a big tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius's family home, that features a family tree that lays it all out. But the actual content of that tapestry isn't entirely included in the books, so there are some gaps.\nFor the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie, designer Miraphora Mina needed to include the tapestry in one of the scenes. So she called up J.K. Rowling, who mapped out the entire Black family for her. It's only from the movie that we have all of the relationships specified.\nIt took six months to design the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes scene in \"Half-Blood Prince.\"\nA display of packaging from Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes.\nThe joke shop \u2014 which Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to at the beginning of the movie \u2014 is filled with whizzing magical pranks, bubbling potions, and everything from Anti Gravity Hats to Self-propelling Custard Pies. It's a feat of imagination and hard work from Fred and George Weasley, and it all had to be re-created for the movie.\nMinaLima made the boxes and labeling for every single item. Everything in the shop had to look like it was manufactured and sold by the Weasley twins, and have a bit of backstory to it.\n\"It was a bit of a dream, really, to have six months to design a load of crazy packaging,\" Mina told INSIDER."}
{"prompt": "The Eagles, after trading LeSean McCoy to the Buffalo Bills, might have found his replacement.\nA person with knowledge of the situation, who requested anonymity, told NJ Advance Media that the Eagles have expressed interest in free-agent running back Frank Gore.\nThat person said a deal with the San Francisco 49ers star could get done as early as Tuesday, the first day free agents can sign with another team.\nAt this point, teams are not allowed to offer contracts to free agents. It is not clear how much it might cost the Eagles to sign Gore.\nGore, 31, finished last season with 1,106 yards on 255 carries and four touchdowns. One of 13 running backs to gain more than 1,000 yards last season, he ranked 10th among backs in the NFL.\nGore ran behind one of the top offensive lines in the NFL. ProFootball Focus ranked the Niners' as the ninth-best unit in the league last season. The Eagles finished second overall on the list.\n", "baseline": "His 4.3 yards per carry average was nearly identical to McCoy's 4.2 yards per carry.\nGore had a season high 119 rushing yards and a 55-yard touchdown reception in the 49ers' Week 4 win over Eagles last season.\nHow much of the workload Gore will get next season remains to be seen. If he joins the team, it's likely he will be the most experienced player on the roster.\nThe Eagles' need for a running back increased when they traded McCoy last week. They have Chris Polk (who they tendered as an unrestriced free agent), Darren Sproles, Kenjon Barner and Matthew Tucker on the roster.\nThere were rumblings on Saturday that the team might be interested in New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram, but Ingram re-signed before being able to accept other offers.\nThe free agency period is expected to be a busy one for the Eagles, who have approximately $46 million in salary-cap space."}
{"prompt": "GENEVA, Mar 18 2013 (IPS) - The current growth model is not sustainable. Neither the green economy nor alternative sources of energy can prevent global warming. Solutions will come from concerted actions at the local and national levels, from the adoption of instruments and practices borrowed from other disciplines like peacebuilding, and from the move to a \u201cno-waste economy\u201d, according to experts here.\nIn its milestone report, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d, published in 1972, the Club of Rome warned that the human ecological footprint had grown dangerously quickly from 1900 to 1972. Shortly thereafter, the warning proved to be prophetic: by 1986 the human ecological footprint had overshot the carrying capacity of the Earth. At current production and consumption levels, we need 1.5 planets to survive; if everyone lived like a U.S. citizen, we would need five planets.\nLand, water and biodiversity continue to decline. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise. The oceans are", "baseline": "warming and the sea level is rising continuously. Forest cover has decreased by 300 million hectares since 1990.\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Crisis of Global Sustainability\u201d, presented in Geneva on Mar. 15, Tapio Kanninen, co-director of a project on sustainable global governance at the City University of New York and member of the Club of Rome, warms that we cannot continue with the current model of economic growth whilst limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius.\nTechnology cannot help us \u2013 it would be environmentally damaging and too costly, he says. We cannot move to alternative sources of energy \u2013 the present alternatives like solar, nuclear and wind contribute relatively little of global energy needs and they are unlikely to replace fossil fuel completely. In short: humanity has reached a stalemate.\n\u201cMany U.N. summits after the (1987) Brundtland Commission have avoided concrete action,\u201d Kanninen said at the book launch Friday.\nThe recent Rio+20 Earth Summit held in Brazil this past June is just one example of the limitations of these international gatherings. Though thousands of participants had hoped the conference would generate concrete solutions and commitments to reducing global warning, the concluding document made no mention of the 30-billion-dollar fund need to transition to a green economy, nor did it outline a blueprint for sustainable development post 2015.\nMost of these summits draw very high-level attendance, but in the end industrialised countries\u2019 national interests dominate the bargaining universe. The global North wants to safeguard its neoliberal economic targets, while the South continues to defend its development goals.\nKanninen advocates for a second review conference of the U.N. charter and a complete paradigm shift.\nKanninen advocates abandoning the old approach of viewing sustainable development as a battlefield and adopting instead instruments from peace-building processes.\nYves Lador, consultant and representative of the U.S.-based Earthjustice at the U.N. in Geneva, told IPS on the sidelines of the book launch that this was an interesting approach.\n\u201cParticularly (with regards) to climate change, we need some trust building measures inspired by the disarmament agreements\u201d, through which governments allow outsiders to monitor their progress. He added that cross verification between different independent monitors could bolster the exercise.\n\u201cThis would be very useful because we don\u2019t know the reality of various countries\u2019 emissions. China, for example, does not make this data readily available. India has problems in data collection, but welcomes outside advice on how to share this data with the public.\nHe cited growing awareness of the link between climate change and human rights as a salient example of the right to information \u2013 namely, the right of the public to know the extent and impacts of climate change and to participate in decision-making.\nA circular economy is, by definition, a restorative economy: products should be designed for longer use and materials reused and recycled, which would increase the demand for maintenance and repairs. The concept has been around since the 1970s but it has gained momentum again due to the activities of the U.S.-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation and to \u201cBankrupting Nature\u201d, a recent report authored by Ander Wijkman and Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, co-president of the Club of Rome.\nHe believes an increase in services like leasing would compensate for the loss of jobs resulting from the decrease in production. Other major companies like Caterpillar have stopped selling huge trucks, and have begun to lease them."}
{"prompt": "TURLOCK , Calif.--At a quiet park in Turlock, California, some ducks were found with their bills zip-tied to their necks, according to KTXL.\nDonnelly Park is a peaceful park in the middle of town. It's popular with families looking to spend some time by the water, under the trees.\nThe park is also home to several ducks.\nBut Sunday night, the ducks had something around their necks and Elizabeth Stevens took some pictures.\n\"I'm pretty sure someone did it to them, just how tight they were and how they were literally cut off as if someone tightened then and then cut it,\" Stevens said.\nThe zip ties were wrapped around the duck's neck, pinning its lower beak to its neck, its mouth open.

{"prompt": "The federal government is accelerating Canada\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon economy, even as conservative politicians in the provinces vow to scuttle key measures that would support that effort.\nNatural Resources Minister Jim Carr endorsed an advisory council report Thursday that spells out an ambitious agenda of increasing energy efficiency, switching off fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\nThe Generation Energy report was produced by an advisory committee appointed by Mr. Carr after he hosted a conference last year on the need for a new Canadian energy strategy. The committee included representatives from the oil and gas industry and the electricity sector, as well as from clean energy and Indigenous organizations.\nThe panel declared that climate change is a growing danger, and that Canada must be part of a global transition to lower-carbon energy needed to avert the most catastrophic impacts.\nHowever, there is considerable political opposition to the Liberal government\u2019s climate-change approach. Conservative politicians argue that Ottawa and its allies among provincial governments are driving up energy costs for Canadians with carbon taxes while undermining the", "baseline": "competitiveness of the domestic oil industry with levies and new regulations.\nDoug Ford will be sworn in as Ontario premier on Friday and has already said he will scrap the province\u2019s cap-and-trade system that not only puts a levy on carbon emissions but finances programs to help homeowners and businesses reduce their energy use. Alberta\u2019s United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney says he will move in a similar direction should he win an election scheduled for next spring.\nThe Generation Energy report is hardly a radical document; the panel\u2019s co-chairs are Merran Smith, president of the advocacy group Clean Energy Canada, and Linda Coady, chief sustainability officer for pipeline and natural gas giant Enbridge Inc.\nThe report includes no call for Canada to rely solely on renewable energy by a certain date; there is no direct attack on the oil sands industry nor opposition to industry\u2019s plan for three pipeline expansion projects that would increase volumes of Canadian crude to U.S. and offshore markets.\nHowever, it does lay out a daunting challenge for the country\u2019s oil and gas sector, which suffered from the global price collapse of 2014-15 and is recovering far more slowly than some international competitors.\nThe goal, it said, is for the Canadian oil industry to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions on a per-barrel basis below that of major competitors, while also reducing costs. To get there, the industry will have to make massive investments in new technology and innovation.\nThat\u2019s a tall order for oil sands companies whose production is among the most carbon intensive in the world, and whose cost structure is high. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers complained recently that climate and other environmental policies are placing an increasing burden on its members that make it difficult to attract investment.\nIn an interview, Mr. Carr said the Generation Energy panel\u2019s conclusion are consistent with the Liberal government\u2019s approach, which emphasizes action on climate change and providing incentives for Canadians to use less energy and lower-carbon energy, while supporting the traditional fossil fuel sector.\nConservative MP Ed Fast slammed the Liberals for undermining the oil and gas industry as it pursues its environmental agenda. \u201cI find it appalling that the Liberals are taking reckless action that will only speed up the decline of the Canadian economy,\u201d the Conservative environment critic said."}

Do we altogether disbelieve in them, because a hundred writers have \" belittled \" the American Indians, and because modern followers of Fenimore Cooper in the frontier lands and on the path of the setting sun are merely animated by a spirit of butchery, and their records are usually lists of slaughter, whether of Indians, or of the animals that are being \"thinned out\" like them? No more than we altogether disbelieve in Man Friday, or accept special corre- spondents' accounts of Bagdad, in exchange for our own old notions of the glorified city where the hunchback lived who made that wonderful rally, after prolonged suffocation by a fishbone, which had such surprising results.\n\" The trees of many acres had been felled, and tho glow of a mild summer evening had fallen on the clearing, in beautiful contrast to the grey light of the forest. A short distance from the place whore Duncan stood, the stream had seemingly expanded into a little lake, covering most of the low land from mountain to mountain. The water foil ont of this wide basin in a cataract so regular and gentle that it appeared rather to be the work of human hands than fashioned by nature. A hundred earthen dwellings stood on the margin of the lake, and oven in its waters, as though the latter had overflowed its usual banks. Their rounded roofs, admirably moulded for defence against the weather, denoted more of industry and free-thought than the natives were wont to bestow on their regular habitations, much less on those they occupied for the temporary purposes of hunting and war The village appeared to be deserted, at least so Duncan thought for many minutes ; but at length ho fancied ho discovered several human forms advancing towards him on all-fours, and apparently dragging in their train some heavy and formidable engine. Just then a few dark-looking heads gleamed out of the dwellings, and the place Boomed suddenly alive with beings, which, however, glided from cover to cover so swiftly as to allow no opportunity of examining their humours or pursuits.\"\nthat shut it in, are fed by the everlasting snow, and in their turn feed the main river, broad, tortuous, and troubled, that cuts its way through the eastern boundary range by a deep oaten, and debouches by a cleft in the rocks, called \" The Gate of the Plains,\" into a vast open valley, which leads to the \"great American prairie.\" The banks of these streams are the still comparatively unmolested homes of the wonderful North-American beaver, of tribes of the strange creature who may be seen at his miniature industry in the Zoological Gardens, handling his invalu- able tail with incomparable skill, and presenting an absurd likeness to Cruikshank's Methodist parsons in the aspect of his damp and shiny bullet-head. Perhaps of all the captive creatures there, the beaver finds it hardest to reconcile himself to circum- stances, for his kind has a special and well founded abhorrence of man, so deep-rooted and so intelligent that the trapping of beaver, as a frontierman of great experience tells us, is a game of skill of the nicest description, and the faintest sus- picion of \" human taint\" upon the \"beaver medicine\" (its in- gredients are a secret) will disconcert the most careful arrange- ments, so that the trapper may as well move on at once .to a distant clime, for not only will he take no fur in the waters which the taint has touched, but the \" office\" will be given down stream. Mr. Campion was instructed in the art of beaver- trapping by the famous Captain John Connor, who is, notwith- standing his name, thoroughbred, and head chief of the Delaware Indians\u2014the tribe of Chingachgook and Uncas\u2014and he holds that as a sport it compares with every other field-sport, as chess does with most indoor games, combining the maximum of skill with the minimum of chance, for it is \" a con- test between acquired skill, knowledge, unremitting care and attention, and the natural instinct\u2014if we may not call it reason \u2014of the most sagacious, acute, and wary of all the brute creation.\"\nThe wariness of the object of their pursuit is a characteristic of the trappers also ; only after cautious observation has con- vinced them that the stranger is really one of the craft will they discuss its mysteries and requirements. Among the latter, am- phibiousness, or at least insensibility to every human ailment likely to be produced by wet and cold, seems to hold an important place. It is pleasanter to think of the wise and industrious creatures in the great solitudes, where no trapper has yet found them, if any such there be (and we believe there are, in the Alaska Territory, where the cold beats even the cupidity of the fur-bunter and the cruelty of the sportsman), where the deep waters and the impenetrable jungle on the river banks are all their own ; where unmolested they dam up their pools and build their houses, with winter bath-rooms, dwelling and store-rooms, and apartments appropriated to interesting events (which are frequent), without any risk of the head of the family coming home minus a hind or forepaw, left in a trap, according to the construction of the horrible instru- ment. Mr. Campion says the beaver is the only animal he is acquainted with who will amputate his own leg in order to escape from a trap ; but other frontiermen tell us that the wolverine exhibits similar sagacity and courage, when he gets into trouble. David Gamut was not annoyed by the sugges- tion of Hawkeye that the sweet singer had meditated teaching the canning beavers to sing to the praise and glory of God, but gravely opined that such intelligent creatures would be glad to thank their Creator, if they did but know how, for His gifts of skill and senses of scent and hearing so far beyond the human, even in a land where those senses are trained to their highest capacity, by constant need and ever present danger. We are reminded of David Gamut's notion, as we read of the beaver of Wet-Mountain Valley, of their spacious houses, with every convenience except air in them\u2014how do the creatures live without it ?\u2014which are entered by a round hole in the river bank a foot under water, with a vestibule varying from four to ten feet, leading to a circular basin four feet deep and of the same width, with a vaulted roof a foot above the level at which the water stands. \" This,\" Mr. Campion tells us, \"is the winter bath-room, its depth below the surface of the ground (the bank of the river being any number of feet high) and its distance back ensuring that the water in it will remain unfrozen.\" Surely the first man who violated the sanctity of a beaver's domicile by demolishing it from the top must have had some compunction, as well as much astonishment, awakened by the spectacle of the radiating passages and the admirably kept rooms in which the little family dwelt ! Surely he must have marvelled exceedingly at the stores of osier twigs, of the inner bark of cotton-wood trees, swamp maples, alders, and willows, cleanly cut, and neatly packed in the moist receptacle, where no frost could get at them, and the family food would remain fresh and tender until spring ! Mr. Campion tells us that the beaver is \" a good theoretical and practical engineer, who cuts down trees larger in proportion to his size than the greatest forest mammoths are to us, choosing them with great judgment, felling them to the exact spot required ; building dams capable of resisting mountain torrents, constructing dwellings showing some knowledge of hydrostatics, and not doing all these things invariably and always alike, as if instinctively only, but changing and adapting his ways and modes of proceeding according to the circumstances of each particular case.\" He is also a keen observer of his most suspected enemy, for an elaborately contrived scare- crow, made to imitate a man, and placed, club in hand, astride a ditch made by a party of diggers for mining purposes, and which took the water from a pool belonging to some beavers, so that it was lowered a few inches, failed to deter them from effectually damming the ditch. They simply pulled the dummy down, took his club from him, cut off his stone feet, floated him down the ditch to a spot where there was a short flume, stuffed him into it, middle first, tucked his head and legs into the corners, and plastered all the crevices up neatly with river-mud. Thus did the beavers \" outsmart\" the men, the beavers no doubt having a Havelock or a Wolseley for their leader, in that favoured portion of the wilderness. Mr. Campion has watched them making their wonderful dams\u2014getting well out of scent, or they would have disappeared in an instant\u2014and amazing as the whole process is, has been most puzzled to conceive how they can estimate the height of a standing tree, since they cannot climb, and the absence of stumps in the scene of their operations shows that they never cut down one which is too short to reach from bank to bank of the stream they mean to dam. Authority worthy of respect has said that the beaver does not use his tail as a trowel, but Mr. Campion opposes this statement with the testimony of his sight. \"Many times,\" he says, \"I have seen the unmistakable print of the beaver's tail on his mud-mortar.\" The construction of these wonderful dams varies in excellence ; there are beavers who scamp their work. Are there contract houses among them, and is their \" lath and plasture \" ever, like that of Miss Miggs's garret, warranted \"not to bear, but the contrairy ?\"\nThese clever, diligent, provident creatures are among the inno- cent and happy races of the animal world. The fierce beasts in the jungle on the river-banks may prowl over their hidden homes, but cannot harm them, and they harm no living thing. Their intense pleasure in the mysterious perfume which forms an in- gredient of the \" beaver medicine \" seems to be one of the cunning cruelties of Nature, like the attraction of the winged-insect tribes to the deadly flame. They are merry, too ; their system is not that of all work and no play (which seems to be a defect of the ant tribes, unless, indeed, it be applied exclusively to the servile races), and the human watcher, from a distance which renders the \" taint \" impossible, may see them, when the moonlight silvers the wastes and the waters, climbing out in groups upon the banks, chasing each other playfully, with funny antics, plunging, dipping, and splashing with their broad, flat tails ; laughing and talking, too, no doubt, after a fashion of their own, and knowing nothing of that which decrees that beaver bonnets shall \" come in\" again and sealskin jackets be trimmed with sleek, fine, beaver fur."}

Those charges had not been made public until last month, after Rezaian had already spent nine months in prison.\nThe 39-year-old correspondent was detained in late July of last year, along with his wife and two photojournalists. The other three were later released, but Rezaian has remained in Evin Prison, one of the country\u2019s most notoriously inhumane facilities, and reportedly kept in isolation and denied medical treatment.\nThe Iranian government is presenting two pieces of evidence of espionage, Mr. Rezaian\u2019s brother, Ali Rezaian, said: an American", "baseline": "visa application for Yeganeh Salehi, Jason Rezaian\u2019s wife, an Iranian citizen and a journalist, and a form letter sent by Mr. Rezaian to Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve relations between Iran and the United States.\nRezaian, who grew up in California and holds dual American-Iranian citizenship, was only allowed to meet with his lawyer once\u2014she reportedly found out the date of the trial through Iranian media. If convicted, Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison.\nBut one potentially telling detail about the otherwise mysterious proceedings is the judge assigned to the case. \u201cThe presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists,\u201d the BBC reported. \u201cHe has been dubbed the \u2018judge of death\u2019 for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests.\u201d In 2011, Salavati was placed on a European Union blacklist for human-rights abuses, and last year, he was also accused of leading a crackdown on political activists and journalists within the country.\nAs the United States and Iran continue to pursue a nuclear deal, some have suggested that Iran could be using Rezaian as a bargaining chip to enhance its position in the negotiations.\nThroughout the nuclear talks, U.S. officials have frequently brought up Rezaian\u2019s case as well as those of other American citizens currently being held in Iran. A number of Republican lawmakers have issued statements calling for the release of Rezaian as a precondition for a nuclear deal with Iran."}
{"prompt": "California is lifting its drought emergency for most of the state after a winter of record rain and snowfall that followed a five-year dry spell.\nGov. Jerry Brown's office announced Friday that his executive order will lift the drought emergency in California, except for Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne counties. Those counties still face groundwater supply shortages.\n\"This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,\" Gov. Brown said. \"Conservation must remain a way of life.\"\nBrown's office also said new legislation will create long-term conservation measures as the state with a history of dry spells anticipates future droughts.\nAbout 8 percent of California is still under some type of drought, according to the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report. At this time last year, more than 90 percent of California fell into at least one of the weekly report's four drought categories.\nMore than 31 percent of California was in the most severe category -- exceptional drought -- in April 2016. That figure dwindled", "baseline": "to 18 percent during the height of winter's storms before falling away later in the season.\nThe only parts of California that remain in moderate drought are northern Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Orange counties. A sliver of extreme southeastern Imperial County remains under severe drought.\nThe announcement ends the 2014 emergency declaration during California's driest four-year period on record. It led to the first conservation rules for the nation's most populated and agriculturally productive state, focused on turning off sprinklers and ripping out thirsty lawns.\nMonster storms this winter doused the Sierra Nevada Mountains with a record snowpack, a key California water source, and boosted reservoirs to normal levels. Melting water runs off the mountain and into a system of aqueducts and reservoirs, providing water for about 23 million Californians.\nWater conservation will become a way of life in the nation's most populated state, Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe.\n\"There's a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,\" she said. \"We've got to plan for longer droughts.\"\nCities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor order, which also bans wasteful practices. New rules are expected to permanently ban wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and watering landscapes in the days after it rains.\nSusan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought is not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years long drought.\nMost of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California's San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still receives calls from people whose wells are running dry and need a tank and bottled water.\n\"In no way is it over,\" she said of the drought. \"We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.\"\nAs for the robust snowpack, it might grow this weekend when an unusually strong spring storm sweeps through California. Electronic monitors last week showed the mountain snowpack was at 164 percent of normal.\nIt was the most dense springtime snowpack since 2011, a year followed by five years of drought.\nRecord-breaking rain in recent months has put a major dent in the drought but also led rivers and creeks to break their banks and wreaked havoc on the state's infrastructure. In February, drought busting storms led to an emergency evacuation of thousands of people downstream from Oroville Dam, where the main spillway broke apart and an emergency spillway eroded. In San Jose, thousands of residents were evacuated a flooded streets filled with mud and debris."}

{"prompt": "History is filled with stories of bold pioneers who changed the world with their visionary ideas. There exists also, in the annals of innovation, a rich tradition of mad scientists with crazy inventions. These two notions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many celebrated breakthroughs were initially met with scorn and ridicule. We've compiled 11 such world-famous ideas from the history of science and technology. The temptation, of course, is to include those ideas that were scorned and should have stayed scorned. The Star Wars prequels, say. But we're trying to run a classy operation here.\nHeliocentrism Galileo Galilei, sometimes called the Father of Modern Science, was among the first and most famous to pay a price for his crazy scientific ideas. Galileo publicly promoted the Copernican concept of heliocentrism -- that the Earth revolves around the Sun -- back when the Church and even most fellow mathematicians held to geocentric model. Unfortunately, in 17th century Rome, such radical ideas were quite literally heresy. Galileo was forced to recant and", "baseline": "spend the rest of his life under house arrest.\nTelephone The question of who actually invented the telephone has inspired a small library full of academic research. But at least one of the earliest telephone prototypes was met with official scorn. In 1860, a full 16 years before Alexander Graham Bell's patent, German schoolmaster Johann Phillip Reis constructed a prototype \"telephon\" and sent the details to a prominent scientific journal. The editors scoffed at the idea of telephonic transmission and Reis' paper was rejected out of hand. Evidence of Reis' work was later suppressed during the telephone patent wars of the 1870s.\nAlternating current As the Reis incident suggests, sometimes public reaction to a new idea is influenced by the competition. In the 1880s, lawmakers and the general public literally feared the use of alternating current (AC) for electric power distribution. AC power was considered dangerous, largely due to an orchestrated public relations campaign by Thomas Edison, who had financial interests in the competing direct current (DC) model. Edison even went so far as to stage public electrocutions of animals to freak people out about alternating current. These demonstrations later led to the invention of the electric chair.\nRadio The Top 40 anthem \"We Built This City\" -- generally considered the worst song ever -- name-drops Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian engineer often credited as the inventor of modern radio. Marconi didn't invent radio at all, actually. Scientists had been tinkering with the tech for years. But Marconi did champion the idea that long-distance radio transmissions could have profound cultural and commercial applications -- adult contemporary rock, for instance. Nevertheless, Marconi's vision was unappreciated at the time. In 1895, Italian officials routed his request for funding to the local insane asylum.\nVelcro In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was taking his dog for a walk when he began to wonder about those irritating burrs that tend to stick to your clothes (or your dog) on a hike. Being an engineer, de Mestral grabbed a microscope and the rest is history. His idea for a hook-and-loop fastener, now known as Velcro, was initially met with condescending skepticism by the European fabric industry. And as we all know, there are few entities more intractable than the European fabric industry. It took another 14 years to patent the \"zipperless zipper\" and in 1999, de Mestral was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame.\nPersonal computer It's hard to even wrap your head around now, but there was a time when the computer was viewed as an unknowable egghead machine with limited practical applicability for the common man -- like the electron microscope or the supercollider. The idea of a personal computer was crazy even to those in the business. \"I think there is a worldwide market for maybe five computers,\" said IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson in 1943. Supposedly. There's some debate over the veracity of this quote, but it does reflect the prevailing attitude of the time.\nCompact discs In the late 1970s, heavyweight competitors Sony and Philips worked together to develop the Compact Disc (CD) format, soon to revolutionize sound recording and distribution. Their biggest obstacle? A profoundly skeptical music industry, who insisted digital would never replace analog technologies like vinyl and cassette. Sony chairman Norio Ohga basically staked his career on the CD format. A classical music connoisseur, Ohga trusted his ear and promoted the CD's superior sound quality. Five years after debuting in Japan, the CD overtook the vinyl LP in total record sales.\nQuasicrystals Good ideas are sometimes dismissed at the molecular level. When famed Israeli scientist Dan Shechtman discovered quasicrystals in the 1980s, he was mocked and kicked off his own research team. Said one competing researcher: \"There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists.\" Not a bad line, really, but Shechtman was vindicated rather spectacularly with a Nobel Prize in 2011. The discovery of quasicrystals changed ideas about the very structure of matter and now represents an entire field of study in materials science. Oh, and Schechtman just announced plans to run for the Israeli presidency.\nIphone and iPad Apple's triumphs in recent years have been so dazzling that its easy to forget the skepticism that preceded the company's flagship mobile products. Tech pundits and (especially) mobile phone executives ridiculed the iPhone concept of an all-in-one device in 2007. Even Apple's traditional rival got in on the action: \"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\" said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in 2007. And remember the incessant jokes about the iPad's name back in 2010? Some joke: The iPad pretty much single-handedly resurrected the tablet as a viable mobile device.\nWearables History tends to repeat itself, so the obvious question is this: Which dubious technology of today will become the breakthrough of tomorrow? You can find plenty of skeptics dismissing the idea of wearables, always-on computing devices such as the smartwatch or Google Glass. Detractors can point to long list of failures in the wearable computing arena. But who knows? Perhaps our future cybernetic overlords will look back 100 years from now and regard wearables with digital fondness -- the breakthrough that sparked the inevitable robot revolution. Only time will tell."}

Among other things, Jose Antonio Vargas\u2019 story today makes that clear on a number of levels.\nOne is that people were willing to help him in a civilly disobedient way, starting with the woman at the DMV who whispered to him that his papers were fake rather than reporting him. Another is that whatever ultimately happens to Vargas, INS agents haven\u2019t rushed to his house to deport him ASAP.

The undocumented and their friends and family and allies have, in other words, the potential to take the broken immigration and really smash it the point where it doesn\u2019t work at all. What the practical output of a crisis like that would be is difficult to say. But the point is that Washington basically doesn\u2019t want this on the agenda. Politicians want to talk about deficit reduction and posture about jobs. But undocumented people could in principle force their way onto the agenda if there was enough will and organization.

{"prompt": "IF you like cricket, and like a brainy writer whose intellectualism is friendly and endearing, you\u2019d better read this book. Mike Brearley was a cricketer with modest abilities, but he possesses a beautiful mind. Most creditably, excelling in cricket and studies at Cambridge didn\u2019t make him insufferable. His mind has trumped his batting feats, which are nondescript \u2014 1,952 international runs at an average of 23.23. But he is extraordinarily cerebral, and it\u2019s primarily due to this that he played 64 international matches, of which he captained in 56. His brain kept him in the team; if not captaining, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the team for so long. His leadership qualities were exceptional, his man management top-drawer \u2014 post-cricket, he became a psychoanalyst.\nBrearley remains acutely aware of his limitations as a player, as is most evident in the chapter on Viv Richards, the original King. Brearley writes with breathlessness and incredulity that Richards treated him as", "baseline": "his peer. We all know Richards had and has no peers, and Brearley knows it too. Richards has respect for the intellect of Brearley. As a force for positive change in cricket, Brearley\u2019s intellect is respected and can be useful, which Richards recognises. Brearley is left awed by the encounter. \u2018I want him to like me,\u2019 he writes. \u2018I am almost surprised he remembers me, that he wants to talk to me. But I don\u2019t feel relaxed. I don\u2019t easily take in what he is saying. I have to listen hard. He is, as my colleague John Stephenson, also present, said afterwards, an alpha male. One can\u2019t imagine a woman not being fascinated. As a man (am I one?), older, in every sense paler, I am charmed, but also a tad intimidated, even by his friendliness.\u2019 Considering Brearley\u2019s high intellect, this extreme modesty seems unreal, artificial. But it\u2019s not fake, for Brearley is a very sincere, earnest man.\nBrearley is perhaps less intimidated when it comes to, say, invoking Socrates when discussing the aesthetics of the game.\nIn short, Brearley resides as easily on the intellectual plane of the sport as on the physical one.\nBrearley wears his intellectualism lightly. A few years ago, as we discussed depression among cricketers, he prefaced almost every sentence with \u2018I think\u2019, \u2018perhaps\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019. When he speaks, he leaves room for a contrary or dissenting view, that\u2019s the generosity of his spirit. Doubt isn\u2019t necessarily a bad attribute.\nHe writes, too, with self-effacing simplicity, having a wry laugh at himself every now and then. Any traces of immodesty he might have had were summarily crushed by his father when he was a teenager, as he relates: \u2018I had been both arrogant and falsely modest, commenting to Mike Griffith and my father that my wicket-keeping was \u2018not quite as good as Mike\u2019s on the leg-side.\u2019 His father told him off, \u2018quietly\u2019. \u2018I felt and can still feel the shame,\u2019 Brearley writes. No wonder Brearley, 60 years on, is touched when the great Viv Richards doesn\u2019t fail to add \u2018I think\u2019 after expressing an opinion to him.\nThis book is valuable for several reasons. One reason is that it\u2019s full of anecdotes and contains affectionate and kind portraits of great players such as Bishan Singh Bedi, Sarfraz Nawaz, Richards, Dennis Lillee and Michael Holding. A more important reason is that it provides terrific food for thought, and can help one get a perspective on something important such as, say, racism.\nAbove all is Brearley\u2019s ability to put himself in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2014 and, more particularly, head. As a philosopher-cricketer, that\u2019s his greatest gift."}
{"prompt": "September 2,2008: Hamas has an image problem, and it's getting worse. It's gotten so bad that the 30 year old son (Mosab Yousef) of one of the Hamas founders (Hassan Yousef) has not only renounced Hamas, but has become a Christian. Mosab is fed up with the terrorism/\"destroy Israel\" approach the Arab world has embraced over the last sixty years. Mosad notes, as have many other Arabs, that this has not worked.\nThe conversion angle is something Moslems are trying to keep quiet. Mosab Yousef's father pleaded with his son to keep quiet about the conversion (which took place 18 months ago). The elder Yousef knows that this is not an isolated incident. Many young Moslems are abandoning Islam. Most do so quietly. In Iran, the clerics that run the country are shocked at secret police reports about a growing number of young Iranians who have, in effect, abandoned Islam. This sort of thing is happening all over the Moslem world, but especially in Arab countries.

In the Palestinian territories, there is also a growth in the number of Sunni Moslems who are switching to the Shia version (as championed by Iran). But many other Moslems are openly distancing themselves from the conservative forms of Islam (like the well funded Saudi Wahhabism). One reason this trend is kept quiet is because Islamic militants are inclined to kill such traitors, if the switch is done too openly. Thus the elder Yousef's plea that his son keep quiet, lest he attract the murderous attention of Islamic radicals out to impose the death sentence on apostates.\nHamas was founded in 1987, as one of the Palestinian terrorist organizations that believed attacking Israeli civilians was the way to victory. Hamas also noted (based on what happened to most of the first generation Palestinian terrorist organizations of the 1960s) that they needed more than violence to survive. So they sought out Moslem charities for donations, and ran many humanitarian programs. Once they had a steady stream of charity money coming in, they could divert some of it to terrorist activities. None of this worked. Israel defeated Hamas terrorism efforts twice (early 1990s, then once more a decade later). When Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006, and refused to drop its demand for the destruction of Israel (as non-Moslem donors, who provided most of the charitable contributions that kept the Palestinian state going, insisted), money dried up and the Palestinian government split into Hamas in Gaza (with 1.4 million people) and Fatah in the West Bank (with 2.4 million people).

{"prompt": "Content protection features in Windows Vista are preventing customers from playing high-quality video and audio and harming system performance, even as Microsoft neglects security programs that could protect users, computer researcher Peter Gutmann argued at the USENIX Security Symposium in Boston Wednesday.\n\"If there was any threat modeling at all, it was really badly done,\" Gutmann, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said while giving a talk on Vista content protection. \"Once the enemy is the user and not the attacker, standard security thinking falls apart.\"\nVista requires premium content like high-definition movies to be degraded in quality when sent to high-quality outputs, so users are seeing status codes that say \"graphics OPM resolution too high.\" Gutmann calls this \"probably the most bizarre status code ever.\"\nWhile Microsoft's intent is to protect commercial content, home movies are increasingly being shot in high definition, Gutmann said. Many users are finding they can't play any content if it's considered \"premium.\"\n\"This is not commercial HD content being blocked, this is the users' own content,\" Gutmann said. \"", "baseline": "The more premium content you have, the more output is disabled.\"\nGutmann, who wore a white T-shirt marked with a Windows Vista logo during his presentation, first issued his criticisms several months ago with a paper titled A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection.\nGutmann's paper called Vista's content protection rules \"the longest suicide note in history.\"\nMicrosoft acknowledged that quality of premium content would be lowered if requested by copyright holders, the BBC reported. Microsoft defended its copyright protections after Gutmann's paper came out, saying they are common features of many playback devices, the BBC article says.\nThe protections allow copyright holders to prevent video from being played in high definition unless users have equipment that supports the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) digital rights management system developed by Intel. If PC users have graphics cards with video connections that don't support HDCP, they are out of luck.\nHigh-definition audio is also blocked in many cases, Gutmann said Wednesday.\n\"It's taking this open architecture that IBM created 25 years ago and making it closed again,\" he said.\nIn a 132-slide PowerPoint presentation, Gutmann outlined numerous features of Vista that he says are frustrating customers and programmers. New functionality related to content protection makes it hard to develop new drivers, he said. When ATI was finally able to ship Vista drivers, they crashed Windows, and Dell and Gateway had to delay Vista upgrades because they couldn't get working drivers, he said.\nGutmann said hardware costs will increase because vendors can't provide Vista-approved security functionality unless Hollywood studios like MGM, 20th Century Fox and Disney grant written approval saying the content security meets their standards.\nA Vista function known as \"tilt bits\" -- like the tilt sensor in pinball machines -- requires hardware and software drivers to report every minor glitch, even ones that cause no problems, Gutmann said.\n\"Every otherwise unnoticeable minor glitch is suddenly surfaced and turned into a showstopper,\" he said.\nSeparately, all the extra encryption required to meet Vista's content protection standards means some computer components can never enter power-saving mode, he said. Thus, when you play a movie your CPU keeps running at full steam, he said. The extra power demands make it hard to reduce electricity usage.\n\"It's a bit of an extreme claim, but you could say Windows Vista causes global warming, because it's burning so much power with all this nonsense,\" Gutmann said.\nThe encryption requirements render high-end graphics processing units less effective, he said, because the best of those products emphasize graphics performance over content protection. On Vista, US$100-video cards can thus outperform those that cost $1,000.\nGutmann argued that Microsoft placed content protection above all other priorities when building Vista, perhaps to gain favor and money from Hollywood. Microsoft should have instead focused this effort on security features that protect users, Gutmann said, such as encrypted paging to protect user secrets, protected content domains that keep out malware, and anti-debugging techniques to prevent rootkit hooking.\nNew Zealand's government, which has argued that digital rights management fails to address the rights of people and government, appears to be the only government worldwide to express public concern about Vista's content protection standards, Gutmann said.\nThis story, \"Vista Prevents Users From Playing High-Def Content\" was originally published by Network World."}

{"prompt": "Jalapenos are used in many spicy dishes and used fresh, dried eaten pickled.\nJalapeno peppers are among the warm-season hot peppers of the Solanaceae family. Hot peppers, like jalapenos, need a long, warm growing season and grow best when planted outdoors as seedlings. You can enjoy fresh peppers or grow them to dry and use in your favorite dishes even if you do not have room for an outdoor garden. You can grow jalapenos in containers indoors and outdoors or grow them hydroponically.\nYou can grow jalapenos outdoors, starting two to three weeks after the last spring frost. Jalapenos require full sun, which is at least six hours of sun daily, and well-drained soil amended with organic matter. The proper pH level for jalapenos is 6.0 to 6.8, so to adjust, add limestone if the pH is low and peat moss if it is higher than 6.8. Sow jalapeno seeds 1/4 to 1", "baseline": "/2 inch deep and space seeds or transplants 18 to 24 inches apart with two to three feet between rows. Water regularly to keep peppers evenly moist.\nJalapenos grow well in large containers if you don't have space in your yard. You need a large container, with a capacity of about 2 to 3 gallons. To successfully grow peppers in a container, they still need enough sunlight and proper care. You can use an all-purpose potting mix, but container plants still require more fertilizer and careful watering. Use a liquid fertilizer once a week and water the container to keep the soil moist. Put the container jalapenos where they will get at least six hours of sun a day.\nYou can grow jalapenos indoors hydroponically using a simple deep-water culture set-up. Peppers grow well with ebb and flow system along with rockwool slabs as a growing medium. Because pepper plants grow tall, they will need support to keep them from falling over. When grown hydroponically, the correct nutrient solution is important, so if you're new to hydroponics, it might be better to use a premixed solution.\nVegetables that grow well together in containers save space while still giving you variety. You can plant vegetables, such as jalapeno peppers, tomatoes and herbs together in one container, making it easy to grow ingredients for your favorite dishes or your favorite herbs for flavoring foods. When growing vegetables all in one container, give each plant plenty of room and leave enough space to accommodate plant growth. Simply fill a container with fresh potting mix, plant the vegetables, water and place in a sunny location. Always use a container with drainage holes.\nAllman, Molly. \"Ways to Grow Jalapenos.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/ways-grow-jalapenos-45100.html. Accessed 25 April 2019."}

And yet Bush and House GOP leaders still balk at passing the one measure that could have: federalizing airport security. Meanwhile, the Justice Department continues to resist legitimate requests for information about the 1,107 people it has detained in connection with the September 11 attacks. Civil liberties organizations and others, including this magazine, have filed a Freedom of Information Act request for information about those detained, warning that the government's \"official silence prevents any democratic oversight of [its] response to the attacks.\" The government should comply.\nUltimately, the antiterrorism campaign could have disastrous consequences if America alienates its allies abroad and its people at home.

Also, the county should know more about non-basketball events at the arena, since those revenues impact potential profits, he wrote.\nMazzella also criticized the Heat, questioning $3.3\u2009million the team spent on capital improvements. He said that money should have gone toward negating losses instead.\nAnd Mazzella questioned certain Heat expenditures, including $12,300 spent on political contributions and $614,000 on lobbyists. The Heat said $10,000 went to a National Conference of Mayors convention in Miami, presided over by former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz.\nLopez, the Heat\u2019s lobbyist who earned a large chunk of the $614,000 in question, called all of the team\u2019s expenses \u201clegitimate\u201d and said the Heat will work harder to get its budgets to the county on time.\nEric Woolworth, president of the Heat Group\u2019s business operations, said in a statement that the audit failed to recognize the successes of the partnership between the Heat and the county \u2014 especially the revitalization of downtown Miami \u2014 and that it gave \u201cshort shrift on the risk\u201d the company took in undertaking construction.\nWoolworth also said Mazzella misinterpreted provisions of the agreement relating to capital expenditures and business expenses.\nThe Heat played its first game at the AAA in 2000, after a dozen years at the old Miami Arena in Overtown. Blessed with fan and corporate support, the team pined for the millions in new revenue anticipated from the sales of expensive suites, exclusive seats and high-end retail at the new arena.\nBroward County offered a better financial deal for the team to play at the BankAtlantic Center, but Heat owner Micky Arison wanted his team to remain in Miami-Dade, where he has a home.\nIn the end, Arison put $210 million toward construction, with the county spending $37.6 million to purchase the 17 waterfront acres along Biscayne Boulevard from the city of Miami. The county also paid a $5\u2009million subsidy before the arena opened and agreed to give the team $6.4 million a year for operations."}

{"prompt": "I\u2019m not one to adhere rigidly to the idea of drinking seasonally: reds when it\u2019s cold, whites and ros\u00e9s when the weather heats up. This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines", "baseline": "that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in any particular order. All are in that $15-to-$20 sweet spot where price intersects with quality and distinctiveness to yield great value. You can certainly find plenty of sound wines for less than $15, but chances are they will not be as interesting.\nFor more than $20, you can start to add in wines that may fit the bill from more highly regarded regions, like the northern Rh\u00f4ne, Priorat, even Burgundy, though pretty soon you could be spending a lot of money.\nStaying in the $15-to-$20 range requires searching outside the status areas, and trying wines that often come from little-known regions, are made from grapes that are not celebrated, and are frequently in limited production. If the wines are more familiar, like California cabernet sauvignon or Oregon pinot noir, they will often be made from young vines, or come from surplus grapes that were sold off.\nWhat you won\u2019t find here are fabricated, artificial products made with technological shortcuts or grapes that come from inappropriate areas, which permit production of cheap bottles in great quantities.\nThis means that most people will be able to find only some of these wines. As always, ask for other recommendations at the best wine shop nearby.\nThe Shebang series, moderately priced wines from Morgan Twain-Peterson\u2019s excellent Bedrock Wine Company, offers modern versions of California field blends. This spicy, gutsy wine comes from multiple vineyards and appellations, includes many grapes (with probably a lot of zinfandel and carignan), and mixes several vintages. The result is a delicious, long-lasting red with flavors of licorice, herbs and red and black fruits.\nCamp\u2019s group of moderately priced Sonoma wines comes from Kenny Likitprakong\u2019s Hobo Wine Company, which makes very good wines from all over California under several labels. This young cabernet is bright and well balanced, with a touch of earth and tannins that simply let you know they are there. It\u2019s easy to enjoy right now, especially with juicy braised meats.\nGood, moderately priced pinot noir from California is tough to find, because most of it comes from areas not well suited to the grape. Searching for well-priced pinot noirs is far more rewarding in Oregon, where land and labor costs have not accelerated out of control. This one from Les Brebis, a small producer in the Willamette Valley, is direct and without the sort of artifice often found in inexpensive pinot noirs. Its earthy flavors of red and black fruits and herbs pair well with pork, chicken and salmon.\nWhy, here\u2019s another one, also from the Willamette, and quite different in style from the Brebis. It\u2019s made from organic and biodynamically grown grapes, and is equally elegant in profile. It\u2019s a little more floral and herbal, and it has a meatier character, with a deliciously savory edge. Try it with hearty soups.\nYet another side of cabernet franc, this one comes from W\u00f6lffer Estate on the South Fork of Long Island. It\u2019s rich and expressive, more in the Bordeaux style than the Loire, less subtle, more open and welcoming. It\u2019s balanced and earthy, and though the tannins are still a bit firm, it will go well with a meaty stew.\nLike W\u00f6lffer Estate, Channing Daughters is based on the South Fork of Long Island, yet the estates could not be more different. W\u00f6lffer takes a more classical approach, but Channing is joyfully experimental, growing an eclectic range of grapes not otherwise seen on Long Island. The \u201915 Rosso Fresco incorporates some of these \u2014 blaufr\u00e4nkisch and dornfelder along with merlot, syrah and cabernet franc. It\u2019s bright, vividly fruity and floral, and absolutely delicious.\nSan Diego? Seriously? While the San Diego coast is more readily associated with beach volleyball and Navy bases, San Diego County is also home to a small wine region with some surprisingly good producers. Vesper Vineyards makes this fruity, smoky, well-balanced carignan tempered by citrus highlights.\nFoxglove is the reliable value arm of Varner Wine, which makes fine chardonnays and pinot noirs. Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It\u2019s juicy and balanced, and will go well with steaks and chops.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the importer of Fattoria La Rivolta Aglianico del Taburno. It is T. Edward Wines, not T. Edwards Wine."}
{"prompt": "A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cerenkov radiation that show up along the photomultiplier tubes lining the detector walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image shows multiple events.\nSometimes, the best-designed experiments fail. The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way. This is how neutrino astronomy was born.\nThe conversion of a neutron to a proton, an", "baseline": "electron, and an anti-electron neutrino is how Pauli hypothesized resolving the energy non-conservation problem in beta decay.\nAlpha decay, where a larger atom emits a helium nucleus, jumping two elements down the periodic table.\nBeta decay, where an atomic nucleus emits a high-energy electron, moving one element up the periodic table.\nGamma decay, where an atomic nucleus emits an energetic photon, remaining in the same location on the periodic table.\nIn any reaction, under the laws of physics, whatever the total energy and momentum of the initial reactants are, the energy and momentum of the final products need to match. For alpha and gamma decays, they always did. But for beta decays? Never. Energy was always lost.\nThe V-shaped track in the center of the image is likely a muon decaying to an electron and two neutrinos. The high-energy track with a kink in it is evidence of a mid-air particle decay. This decay, if the (undetected) neutrino is not included, would violate energy conservation.\nIn 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed a new particle that could solve the problem: the neutrino. This small, neutral particle could carry both energy and momentum, but would be extremely difficult to detect. It wouldn't absorb or emit light, and would only interact with atomic nuclei extremely rarely.\nUpon its proposal, rather than confident and elated, Pauli felt ashamed. \"I have done a terrible thing, I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected,\" he declared. But despite his reservations, the theory was vindicated by experiment.\nReactor nuclear experimental RA-6 (Republica Argentina 6), en marcha, showing the characteristic Cherenkov radiation from the faster-than-light-in-water particles emitted. The neutrinos (or more accurately, antineutrinos) first hypothesized by Pauli in 1930 were detected from a similar nuclear reactor in 1956.\nor they cause the emission of new particles, which have their own energies and momenta.\nEither way, you can build specialized particle detectors around where you expect the neutrinos to interact, and look for them. This was how the first neutrinos were detected: by building particle detectors sensitive to neutrino signatures at the edges of nuclear reactors. If you reconstructed the entire energy of the products, including neutrinos, energy is conserved after all.\nSchematic illustration of nuclear beta decay in a massive atomic nucleus. Only if the (missing) neutrino energy and momentum is included can these quantities be conserved.\nIn theory, neutrinos should be produced wherever nuclear reactions take place: in the Sun, in stars and supernovae, and whenever an incoming high-energy cosmic ray strikes a particle from Earth's atmosphere. By the 1960s, physicists were building neutrino detectors to look for both solar (from the Sun) and atmospheric (from cosmic ray) neutrinos.\nA large amount of material, with mass designed to interact with the neutrinos inside of it, would be surrounded by this neutrino detection technology. In order to shield the neutrino detectors from other particles, they were placed far underground: in mines. Only neutrinos should make it into the mines; the other particles should be absorbed by the Earth. By the end of the 1960s, solar and atmospheric neutrinos had both successfully been found.\nThe particle detection technology that was developed for both neutrino experiments and high-energy accelerators was found to be applicable to another phenomenon: the search for proton decay. While the Standard Model of particle physics predicts that the proton is absolutely stable, in many extensions \u2014 such as Grand Unification Theories \u2014 the proton can decay into lighter particles.\nIn theory, whenever a proton does decay, it will emit lower-mass particles at very high speeds. If you can detect the energies and momenta of those fast-moving particles, you can reconstruct what the total energy is, and see if it came from a proton.\nHigh-energy particles can collide with others, producing showers of new particles that can be seen in a detector. By reconstructing the energy, momentum, and other properties of each one, we can determine what initially collided and what was produced in this event.\nIf protons decay, their lifetime must be extremely long. The Universe itself is 1010 years old, but the proton's lifetime must be much longer. How much longer? The key is to look not at one proton, but at an enormous number. If a proton's lifetime is 1030 years, you can either take a single proton and wait that long (a bad idea), or take 1030 protons and wait 1 year to see if any decay.\nA liter of water contains a little over 1025 molecules in it, where each molecule contains two hydrogen atoms: a proton orbited by an electron. If the proton is unstable, a large enough tank of water, with a large set of detectors around it, should allow you to either measure or constrain its stability/instability.\nA schematic layout of the KamiokaNDE apparatus from the 1980s. For scale, the tank is approximately 15 meters (50 feet) tall.\nIn Japan, in 1982, they began constructing a large underground detector in the Kamioka mines. The detector was named KamiokaNDE: Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment. It was large enough to hold over 3,000 tons of water, with around a thousand detectors optimized to detect the radiation that fast-moving particles would emit.\nBy 1987, the detector had been running for years, without a single instance of proton decay. With around 1033 protons in that tank, this null result completely eliminated the most popular model among Grand Unified Theories. The proton, as far as we could tell, doesn't decay. KamiokaNDE's main objective was a failure.\nA supernova explosion enriches the surrounding interstellar medium with heavy elements. The outer rings are caused by previous ejecta, long before the final explosion. This explosion also emitted a huge variety of neutrinos, some of which made it all the way to Earth.\nBut then something unexpected happened. 165,000 years earlier, in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, a massive star reached the end of its life and exploded in a supernova. On February 23, 1987, that light reached Earth for the first time.\nBut a few hours before that light arrived, something remarkable happened at KamiokaNDE: a total of 12 neutrinos arrived within a span of about 13 seconds. Two bursts \u2014 the first containing 9 neutrinos and the second containing 3 \u2014 demonstrated that the nuclear processes that create neutrinos occur in great abundance in supernovae.\nThree different detectors observed the neutrinos from SN 1987A, with KamiokaNDE the most robust and successful. The transformation from a nucleon decay experiment to a neutrino detector experiment would pave the way for the developing science of neutrino astronomy.\nand that neutrinos aren't slowed down as they travel from the core of the collapsing star to its photospher, the way that light is.\nEven today, more than 30 years later, we can examine this supernova remnant and see how it's evolved.\nThe outward-moving shockwave of material from the 1987 explosion continues to collide with previous ejecta from the formerly massive star, heating and illuminating the material when collisions occur. A wide variety of observatories continue to image the supernova remnant today.\nThe scientific importance of this result cannot be overstated. It marked the birth of neutrino astronomy, just as the first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes marked the birth of gravitational wave astronomy. It was the birth of multi-messenger astronomy, marking the first time that the same object had been observed in both electromagnetic radiation (light) and via another method (neutrinos).\nIt showed us the potential of using large, underground tanks to detect cosmic events. And it causes us to hope that, someday, we might make the ultimate observation: an event where light, neutrinos, and gravitational waves all come together to teach us all about the workings of the objects in our Universe.\nThe ultimate event for multi-messenger astronomy would be a merger of either two white dwarfs or two neutrons stars that was close enough. If such an event occurred in near-enough proximity to Earth, neutrinos, light, and gravitational waves could all be detected.\nMost cleverly, it resulted in a renaming of KamiokaNDE. The Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment was a total failure, so KamiokaNDE was out. But the spectacular observation of neutrinos from SN 1987A gave rise to a new observatory: KamiokaNDE, the Kamioka Neutrino Detector Experiment! Over the past 30+ years, this has now been upgraded many times, and multiple similar facilities have popped up all over the world.\nIf a supernova were to go off today, in our own galaxy, we would be treated to upwards of 10,000 neutrinos arriving in our detector. All of them, combined, have further constrained the lifetime of the proton to now be greater than around 1035 years, but that's not why we build them. Whenever a high-energy cataclysm occurs, neutrinos speed through the Universe. With our detectors online, neutrino astronomy is alive, well, and ready for whatever the cosmos sends our way."}

In previous iterations of its climate policy, released during the Bush administration, the Canadian government pushed for emission intensity targets for a broad range of industries, including oil sands producers, rather than sectoral emission caps.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Jacobson, a close acquaintance of President Obama, toured the oil sands. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about the tremendous strides that have been taken over the last several years with respect to improving the environmental record in treating the oil sands,\u201d he told Reuters.\nBut at the other end of the diplomatic relationship, Canada\u2019s new ambassador to Washington, Gary Doer, told The Calgary Herald last week that the oil sands get a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d amount of criticism."}

My beef hasn\u2019t simply been about judgment calls that appeared to be judged incorrectly (those happen), but rather with the mechanics.\nCrews have often bumbled yardage mark offs, spots (the ball can\u2019t be exactly on the yard line EVERY time \u2013 that\u2019s lazy), downs and rules. The common occurrences expose inexperienced, perhaps undertrained officials.\nHowever, there are reasons for the above. Who in the heck would want to be an official today?

I\u2019m not sure if some coaches spent more time calling plays and schemes or crawling in the ear holes of the folks in stripes.\nThe actions in the stands isn\u2019t any better. If the right team wins or executes a terrific play, fans are happy. If not, it\u2019s the officials\u2019 fault. The mind-set is completely out of control.\nI covered the North Webster-Loyola game last week and witnessed the cops called to the field twice. One instance involved a disruptive member of the chain gang, the second sent a handful of officers to track down an unruly, profanity-loving fan.\nYoung athletes aren\u2019t winning in life if parents and coaches conjure excuses to blame everyone else for a lack of execution or the fact another team/player is simply better. Winning is terrific; I\u2019m as competitive as they come. However, losing can teach us all just as much, and, in the long run, produce victories.\nI\u2019ve never heard of a college coach or NFL scout pass on a kid because the referee made a bad call. If your kid is good enough, he or she will get there. And it\u2019s better off if they\u2019re tough and able to self-evaluate. If they look the other way and point fingers amid adversity, good luck, the road will be much bumpier.\nIt\u2019s not good for anyone to look into the stands and see parents literally fighting (not at the Week 10 game I attended), or throwing food on the field because of a perceived bad call. It\u2019s also not good to see officials (barely) escape a mob of hysterical fans \u2013 despite the help of policemen -- at a local game.\nOne local coach called the referee at the center of the Loyola-North Webster game \u201cthe one guy I\u2019d choose to referee my games.\u201d The point: Officials, like your favorite team, can struggle. They\u2019re human. But they didn\u2019t put your boys in a three-touchdown hole.\nAmazingly, fans don\u2019t credit officials after victories. How is that possible?\nI'm more incensed by the aftermath of such incidents like the ones I witnessed at Loyola. Adult rarely (at best) take responsibility for their \u2013 or fellow fans\u2019 \u2013 actions. A bad call doesn\u2019t give the rest of us carte blanche. Imagine if everyone around you lost their marbles and you became a bull's-eye for vitriol after you dub a coach\u2019s decision \u201cidiotic\u201d moments before it works and you\u2019re on your feet cheering.\nNo one gets it all right.\nAs Friday\u2019s game developed, some of the Loyola players popped off in frustration, and that\u2019s not to be excused, but they, along with Loyola coaches, were ultimately forced to turn from the field of play and tell their fan base to cool it as things got heated at Messmer Stadium.\nThe kids had to tell the parents to act like adults.\nBy no stretch are the officials or fans present at the Loyola game the only problem. I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 on and off the field -- all season. However, it was Week 10. We\u2019re now in the postseason. If we don\u2019t compose ourselves, playoff implications could take rage to another level and that\u2019s when national headlines \u2013 not good ones -- could be made.\n\u201cJohnny\u201d doesn\u2019t want to carry the burden of watching his parents punching (or worse) a fan or official on YouTube for the rest of his life.\nBoo the officials or opposing fans all you want, it\u2019s tradition. However, verbal and physical abuse is sometimes illegal and always completely embarrassing. The actions, the threats toward officials are getting worse.\nI know social media, and the current climate, has made it OK to call each other names, disrespect one another and demean opinions without merit, but for crying out loud think about your actions when you\u2019re in public. At least spam-like usernames and accounts can help hide your identity on social media.\nBut Friday nights are real life. With real-life implications. Coach the games, watch the games, officiate the games. Stop deflecting blame and embrace the teachable moments in wins and losses. And more importantly, remember those are fellow human beings who drop passes, miss blocks and butcher pass interference calls.\nWe can all be better. We must be better."}

{"prompt": "Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Niro will collaborate for the first time in decades.\nMartin Scorsese's \"Silence\" may have been his 28-year-old passion project, but it was mostly ignored by audiences, grossing only $7 million in the U.S. opposite a $40 million budget. Something tells us the same fate won't meet the director's next project, which carries an even bigger budget and bigger stars.\nJack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Departed\"\nScorsese has built his career on iconic gangster movies, from \"Goodfellas\" to \"Casino,\" \"Mean Streets\" and \"The Departed,\" so his return to the genre after more than a decade is cause for celebration.\n\"The Irishman\" is based on the 2003 book \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" by Charles Brandt, which recounts the years Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran spent as a mob hitman. Brandt interviewed Sheeran over a five-year period, during which the mobster confessed to being", "baseline": "involved in more than 25 hits for the mob. Sheeran was allegedly involved in the death of legendary mob boss Jimmy Hoffa, who went missing in July 1975 and was never found.\nAnyone hoping for Scorsese to capture the cinematic energy of \"Goodfellas\" once again may want to lower their expectations. It appears the filmmaker is going to be making a much more elegiac and sobering gangster movie this time around. \"The Irishman\" picks up with Sheeran as an older man as he looks back on the hits that defined his mob career.\n\"The people are also older in 'The Irishman,' it's certainly more about looking back, a retrospective so to speak of a man's life and the choices that he's had to make,\" Scorsese told The Independent in May.\nAs to whether the movie follows in the tradition of \"Goodfellas\"? He told the outlet, \"I think this is different, I think it is. I admit that there are - you know, 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' have a certain style that I created for them - it's on the page in the script actually\u2026The style of the picture, the cuts, the freeze-frames, all of this was planned way in advance, but here it's a little different.\"\nRobert De Niro in \"Casino\"\nScorsese and Robert De Niro's careers are intertwined after making eight movies together, including \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"The King of Comedy.\" But the duo haven't made a movie together since \"Casino,\" which was released 22 years ago in November 1995. \"The Irishman\" will mark their ninth collaboration.\nWhile Scorsese's career in the two decades since has remained strong, De Niro hasn't really had a critically acclaimed lead dramatic role in several years. He earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" but reuniting with Scorsese is just what his big screen career needs most right now.\nJoe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro in \"Goodfellas\"\nThe supporting cast for \"The Irishman\" is truly an embarrassment of riches: Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Bobby Cannavale. But arguably the most anticipated bit of casting is Joe Pesci, who has only had two credits to his name this century: A cameo in De Niro's 2006 CIA drama \"The Good Shepherd\" and a lead role in Taylor Hackford's 2010 flop \"Love Ranch.\" Prior to 2006, Pesci hadn't starred in a single movie since 1998's \"Lethal Weapon 4.\" The semi-retired actor is officially coming back to the big screen for a \"Goodfellas\" reunion with Scorsese and De Niro.\nPesci had been rumored to be joining \"The Irishman,\" but his casting wasn't confirmed until earlier this month. He's reportedly playing Russell Bufalino, a Mafia boss operating out of Pennsylvania who has long been suspected of having a hand in Hoffa's disappearance. The character means we'll most likely be seeing Pesci and De Niro in scenes opposite one another.\nScorsese and Pesci have made three movies together. Pesci won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in \"Goodfellas.\"\n\"The Irishman\" will follow in the footsteps of \"Hugo\" as a Scorsese movie that depends heavily on visual effects. The director is teaming with George Lucas' VFX company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to utilize the same effects used on Brad Pitt in \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" so that De Niro can be digitally aged to look younger in the flashback scenes.\n\"The Irishman\" will include flashbacks that span decades, and De Niro is set to play Sheeran in all of them. He'll appear as young as 30 years old.\nThe visual effects required for \"The Irishman\" are part of the reason the film's budget is over the $100 million mark. That's a massive price tag for any filmmaker, and it's why Scorsese has taken up shop at Netflix to make the movie despite his love of the theatrical experience over streaming.\n\"The Irishman\" has been in development since 2008 and was originally going to be backed by Paramount Pictures, but the studio couldn't afford to take on such a risky budget. International rights were purchased by STX Entertainment for $50 million at Cannes 2016, but they backed down after Netflix took over for Paramount and bought worldwide streaming rights.\n\"The Irishman\" is officially shooting in New York City this summer, with a production start date set for the middle of August. Principal photography is scheduled until December. The five-month shoot will just a bit longer than the filming of \"Silence,\" which took place in Taiwan from January 30 to May 15, 2015. But it's nothing compared to \"Gangs of New York\" shoot. That massive production lasted for nearly eight months (August 2000 - April 2001).\nMatin Scorsese and Andrew Garfield on the set of \"Silence\"\nA lot of attention surrounding \"The Irishman\" is being paid to the people appearing in front of the camera, but just as exciting are the collaborators joining Scorsese behind it. Most notable is cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who has become a favorite of Scorsese's in recent years after shooting both \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Silence.\" The latter earned him his second Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. His first was for \"Brokeback Mountain\" in 2005. Prieto first earned attention for his work with Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\"Amores perros,\" \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\").\nScreenwriter Steve Zallian, meanwhile, adapted the book for the big screen. Zallian, who just earned an Emmy nomination for directing his HBO limited series \"The Night Of,\" wrote the script for Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" and earned an Oscar nomination. He won Best Adapted Screenplay for \"Schindler's List\" in 1993.\nScorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker will also return for \"The Irishman.\" She was the editor on the director's 1967 feature debut, \"Who's That Knocking at My Door,\" and has edited all of his films since \"Raging Bull\" in 1980. Her work with Scorsese has resulted in six Oscar nominations for Best Editing and three wins (\"Raging Bull,\" \"The Aviator\" and \"The Departed\").\nAnd now for the bad news: \"The Irishman\" won't be released until 2019. At the very earliest we could get an Oscar-qualifying run in select theaters in late December 2018, but reports say Netflix is eyeing a day-and-date rollout in 2019.

The solution to the puzzle is that there are droughts and then there are droughts.\n\u201cThere is a time lapse in how different systems respond to current conditions,\u201d is how Richard Kiah, chief of Hydrologic Network Operations for the regional office of the U.S. Geological Survey, puts it.\nIn laymen\u2019s terms: When wet weather appears, as it did in July, after a long stretch of very dry weather like we had this spring, the grass starts growing pretty quickly but it takes longer to fill up the aquifers that our wells depend on. A drought above ground might end, might even give way to flooding, while drought lingers below ground.\nThat\u2019s roughly", "baseline": "what we\u2019re seeing now, although thankfully the drought and flooding have been minor compared to other parts of the country.\nAs of Saturday, the official rainfall total in Concord for the month of August is 9.36 inches, breaking the all-time August record of 9 inches, set in 1892. Even so, Concord and the swath of central New Hampshire from Sullivan County to Carroll County are officially \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d the first of five categories on the federal drought-measurement scale.\nThis discrepancy is a function of the \u201ctime lapse\u201d that Kiah mentioned above. As an illustration, he pointed to the town of Warner.\nUSGS maintains a series of measuring devices around the state that keep track of groundwater levels, meaning how much water is available for wells, and other devices that measure how much is flowing on the surface in rivers. Warner has a stream gauge measuring flow on the Warner River, and also a groundwater well nearby.\nAt the end of March, which is roughly when the dry spell began, the stream gauge in Warner was measuring water flow above the 95th percentile point for that time of year, meaning more water was flowing in the river than almost late March in history. The groundwater level was almost that high as well: It was in the 90th percentile.\nBy mid-July, after two months of bone-dry weather, the surface stream gauge had plunged almost to the 10th percentile, meaning that nearly nine out of 10 past Julys had seen more water in the river, definitely a drought signal. Yet at the same time, groundwater gauge was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, just slightly under the long-term average.\nBoth gauges are now trending upwards, and I would guess that in the next few weeks central New Hampshire will be out of the drought category entirely, as they are already in southern New Hampshire. It\u2019s not straightforward, though.\nThe designation of drought requires more than just measuring recent rainfall or water flows. Other factors intrude, notably evapotranspiration, which is the measure of how much of the moisture falling from the ground and existing in the air as humidity is used by plants.\n\u201cAt this time of year, some of the rainfall is not going to be recharging the groundwater, it\u2019s going to be taken up by the plants and trees,\u201d Kiah said. So even if a wet period is good for plants, fixing the agricultural drought, it may not be all that good for long-term water supplies.\nAll this makes determining whether we\u2019re in a drought something of an art as well as a science, balancing the needs of plants and people today with the needs of plants and people in the coming weeks and months.\n\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s drought management plan takes into account these things,\u201d Kiah said.\nThe terminology goes from meteorological drought, due to a lack of rain, to agricultural drought, when the soil dries out, to hydrological drought, affecting groundwater and stream flows. Perhaps what should happen is that we give up on the idea of announcing whether we\u2019re in a drought and instead announce whether we\u2019re in any of three possible types of drought.\nBut probably not. That would confuse people more than enlighten them.\nAfter all, designating a drought is as much a social and political marker as a scientific marker. It gives governments authority to impose watering bans and it motivates people to save water. Even if it isn\u2019t always logically consistent, it\u2019s still useful."}

Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nUnder a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.\nVan de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday\u2019s Whitehaven AGM were \u201can opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing\u201d.\n\u201cThese sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,\u201d he said.\nClimate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace.\nAt last week\u2019s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company\u2019s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin.\nThe Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company\u2019s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about \u201cstranded asset risk\u201d.\n\u201cAt some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,\u201d Poole said."}

The jobs pay $30,000 to $47,000 a year, according to state employment figures.\nWithout the license, students would only qualify for lower-paid jobs as lab assistants, for example, who freeze specimens or prepare blood or urine samples to be tested, said Debbie Wagner of Cupertino-based DeAnza College.\nWagner runs one of only two programs approved by the California Department of Public Health to train medical laboratory technicians.\n\u201cWhy would they pay $10,000 to be trained for a job that doesn\u2019t pay any more than they earn now?\u201d said the students\u2019 lawyer, Scott Schutzman, who filed the Orange County Superior Court lawsuit in June.\nThe confusion seems to result from changes in the state law that took place in December, when the Department of Public Health began regulating medical laboratory technician jobs and giving them more authority and pay. Before December, only trained scientists with advanced degrees were allowed to perform blood counts, urinalysis, cholesterol and other laboratory tests in California.\nHowever, because of a lack of a workforce, the state began the process several years ago of changing the job descriptions to allow a newly created breed of trained and licensed medical laboratory technicians to perform those tests.\nWagner said that people in the field had been aware for years that the rules were changing and that, in fact, that\u2019s why she started DeAnza\u2019s program.\nNewbridge students said they only learned they were ineligible for the technician jobs during a field trip to a hospital laboratory, when a lab director told them she would only hire them as assistants.\nZakarin said that, prior to the change in the law, medical lab technician programs \u201cdid not need DPH approval\u201d except for the aspects that included phlebotomy certification, which involves drawing blood.\nThe job to which he\u2019s referring, though, is that of a lab associate \u2013 essentially an assistant, not a technician who actually performs the tests.\n\u201cAfter the change in the law, the specific MLT job outcome required an associate\u2019s (degree) and because NC\u2019s program is a diploma program; it was not eligible for DPH approval of the entire program,\u201d Zakarin said.\nRegister news researcher Michael Doss contributed to this report."}

{"prompt": "Seven years ago the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited one out of every 90 individual income tax returns. Last year it was one out of every 119. This year it is expected to be just one out of every 143. And for those who don\u2019t include a Schedule C or other special (i.e., tax shelter, farm income) forms, the audit rate drops even further: one out of every 330.\nEven high-income earners (over $1 million a year) can breathe easier, at least for the moment. In 2015, the agency audited nearly 10 out of every 100 of those returns while this year it\u2019ll only be able to audit fewer than six. Business audits have also been declining. Four years ago the IRS audited nearly 10,000 businesses while last year that number dropped to just 6,453.\nThe decline is due to punishment through budget cuts by Congress for the agency\u2019s egregious mismanagement and malpractice behaviors including Commissioner John Kosk", "baseline": "inen\u2019s lying to Congress last year, which almost got him impeached, and the political profiling of Tea Party groups before that. The IRS now employs fewer than 80,000 people, down from 94,722 in 2010, with the enforcement staff seeing the most drastic declines: more than 30 percent since 2010.\nThe IRS has a history of overreach and mismanagement. In 2003, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found IRS lawyers Kenneth McWade and William Sims guilty of blackmailing taxpayers in order to obtain testimony against other taxpayers. They consequently were disbarred. In May 2015, the agency announced that its computer systems had been hacked and that, as a result, the private tax information of more than 100,000 citizens had been stolen. In August of that year, the IRS said that the breach was far larger than originally thought: 220,000 additional private files had been compromised. A few months later, in February 2016, the IRS admitted that the previous disclosures were in error: More than 700,000 Social Security numbers and other \u201csensitive\u201d information had been stolen.\nAll of that appears to be ancient history with the new sheriff in town, President Donald Trump, and his deputy, Steven Mnuchin, heading up the Treasury Department. Mnuchin knows that for every 35 cents that it spends in collection efforts the IRS brings in $100. He knows that whistleblowers have brought in billions. He knows that the new program to revoke passports of those taxpayers owing more than $50,000 is likely to force them to pay up. He knows that for every $1 it spends on face-to-face audits with taxpayers the agency reaps $4 in return. He knows that for every dollar of new revenue it might receive from Congress it could generate between $4 and $6 dollars in revenue. He knows that Trump is a businessman very familiar with such numbers. Consequently Mnuchin thinks he can make a \u201creturn-on-investment\u201d case that could result in a significant increase in the IRS\u2019s current budget of $11 billion.\nDespite the new deputy in charge of the Treasury, which runs the IRS, Trump will likely have a tough time getting Congress to approve any more than a modest increase in the agency\u2019s budget. In the meantime taxpayers have a little more time to breathe a little easier."}

That's why I think of it as abandonment of something I should have treasured, why I look back on it as running away. So much was lost.\nFor years, I have punished myself for that decision. Even though living in New York for a few years was a positive, nourishing experience, I took my inner turbulence with me.

{"prompt": "The Cats have wrapped up on the field for the day--and a sweltering one it was----and here are a couple of observations that my pal Drew probably would have had out there a lot earlier, but he's enjoying a well-deserved day off.\n* The Cats are fast. Flat out, no modifiers.\n*The defence is so far ahead of last year at this point that it's useless to even try to compare. Huge defensive plays made several times by both Rico Murray and Pawel Kruba at linebacker. Some guys who made starts last year will not make this team, is our guess.\n*The Canadian depth of this team is ridiculously good, and we'll address that a bit in the main column today (which is about Ted Laurent).\n* Obviously, as the top of the five-man quarterback pyramid, Zach Collaros got the A reps in team and \"skelly\" sessions in Monday's second day of Tiger-Cat training camp. The bulk of the rest of the reps went to Jeremiah Masoli, No. 3 on the depth chart last year.\n\"The quarterback", "baseline": "s understand that there isn't enough time to get reps for them each day,\" explained head coach Ken Austin of the way pivot assignments will be handled in training camp. \"We don't have enough reps to distribute five deep, or even four deep.\n\"Sometimes there is a modification, though, because we do things by concept. So if a quarterback is short of reps on a certain concept, then we have to rotate it differently to make sure that he comes up to curve in some learning, where he didn't have enough reps.\n\"There is a lot that goes into it each night as we plan reps.\"\nHere's part of the plan, we'll guess: Collaros gets every rep he needs, especially with the prospect of a strike/lockout which could cost precious development time for a guy trying to go from a seven-game No. 2, to an 18-game No. 1.\n*Andy Fantuz has never held for a left-footed kicker. Justin Medlock returns to the team after a two-year NFL absence and, apparently, is still kicking with his left foot.\nFantuz said it's an adjustment because Medlock is not only left-footed, he does not use a kicking tee---Medlock says that's actually easier for a holder once he gets used to it---and because unlike other kickers Medlock does not like the ball held down from the top with one or two fingers or the whole hand, but likes the tip of the ball pinched between forefinger and thumb to make it easier to rotate, if necessary.\nMedlock says it'll take 200 practice snaps to get it right but will he have that with Fantuz, who's a first-stringer on offence?\nNo, it says here. That's one reason why Jason Boltus, third-string quarterback, was his holder here before. Receivers Luke Tasker and Corey Koch both with reliable, and big, hands like Fantuz are also asking for practice time as holder.\n*Austin was asked whether he'd like to carry five quarterbacks as he did last year.\n\"We're trying to push to about eight or nine,\" he quipped before adding. \"I don't know. if there's a ned to do that we will.\"\n* And how is Collaros making out in his adaptation to the Austin Way, which requires an awful lot of conceptual knowledge and reaction to what's playing out in front of him?\n\"He's improving a lot,\" Austin said. \" It doesn't matter what new system you go into, there's new terminology. It's like Greek af first. First you have to get comfortable with the terminology then you have to understand WHY we're doing what we're doing, and not just what. You can't have a robotic memory, coming out on this football field, you have to learn conceptually because of our adjustments. That takes time to sink in, but Zach's doing agreat job right now in his understanding and progression of learning.\"\nTed doesn't only look big he plays big.\nMasoli (well, Austin's brilliance) got us home field advantage last year.\nWhat a difference a gm makes. Old picked up other teams castoffs. Even Glenn was cut even before training camp in Peg. Before comming here as saviour. New: even last years starters might not make team ?! Wow. From replacing garbage with garbage to replacing starters with stars!!\nAnd fast! I was wondering how our new QB was doing myself, even after only 2 days so thanks for addressing it, Mr Steve!\n2014: the Year of the Cats!\nIt is truly great to hear (but I'm not really surprised) that the Ticats are way ahead of where they were last season. Continuity of coaching staff and keeping the core of players together will do that. With a new QB, offense could take a bit longer to come together but then that was true last year when EVERYONE was learning a new system. Great to hear too that there is lots of speed, some of which was evident at times last season.\nAs for Medlock's holder - I would think that they might try out someone who is NOT a first string player. Last year when Fantuz was injured Congi had to adjust to a different holder (Bartel). Of course any player could be injured during the season, but using a backup (like they did with Boltus - maybe Lauther would work?) might avoid the possibility of having to substitute someone less familiar (or completely unfamiliar) with Medlock's style in case of injury.\nThe man just known as Ted.\n@Ryan y - How well he's coming along? It's Day 2 of camp... isn't it a little early to be asking that? We heard a bit of feedback after the OTA, but still, what else is a coach supposed to say at this point? And what are reporters supposed to be noticing when the drills have just been getting under way?\nRe: holders for placekicking, I'm curious about the thinking behind continuing to use a receiver to do the job, versus one of the backup QBs - they can certainly run the ball if the snap is botched, but you'd think having someone like Masoli or LeFevour doing it would open up more options on a broken placekick.\nIs it just me or are the ticats and reporters Being VERY careful about raising the fans expectations about how well Collaros is coming along? There have no articles about how great he is doing and Kent Austin gives the same cookie cutter responses whenever a reporter asks. I don't know maybe I've gotten used to the nfls reporters and their hyperbole over the off season but it scares me. This guy played one very bad preseason game last year I remember thinking wow he's terrible and lost the backup job to the argos Harris. I'm not sure how he ended up being second string again when Ricky went down but this kid is a HUGE gamble. And I think people should start to gear back the expectations a bit about a return to and winning the grey cup this year I think this kid might need a year or two to learn the game and become what all his potential says he could be.\nCould have used Laurent last year! Should have used the Gaydosh pick to get him! Oh well, better late than never.\nAlso agree that speed is good... Just look at how dangerous our STs were when Thigpen or Williams were returning the kicks for TDs.\nI haven't had a chance to get to camp yet... So will rely on others... How does Plesius look at MLB?\nGlad to hear team is fast; as many coaches have said \"you can't coach/teach speed\".\nNot surprised Masoli is 2nd QB (so far). I think he adds a quite different dimension to Ticat offence, whereas Lefevour is very similar in skills to Collaros.\nSigning of Laurent is huge, Ticats will have so many ratio options this year."}

Absent the psychological tension, technical showmanship and stylistic sleight-of-hand of \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d this yarn from Hong Kong writer-helmer Derek Yee is unable to harmonize a mix of political intrigue and vaudevillian humor, while an excess of magic acts keeps the sterling cast too physically busy to breathe feeling into their roles. Out of touch with contempo urban tastes, the pic is unlikely to conjure dazzling B.O. in China or satisfy overseas cravings for martial arts-centric titles.\nNorthern China in the \u201920s is embroiled in territorial feuds between warlords, one", "baseline": "of whom is is Lei Daniu, aka Bully (Sean Lau Ching-wan), who uses the mentalist skills of his butler, Liu Kunshan (Wu Gang), to recruit soldiers. Bully is besotted with pretty acrobat Yin (Zhou Xun), whom he captured and forcibly made his seventh concubine while her fiance was in Europe. Meanwhile, Yin\u2019s magician father, Liu Wanyao (the helmer\u2019s brother, Paul Chun), has disappeared.\nWhen the mysterious Zhang Xian (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) arrives in Beijing to stage spectacular magic shows, Bully seeks his help to impress the frosty Yin. To his consternation, the suave and Westernized Zhang is more beguiling than he bargained for.\nased on Zhang Haifan\u2019s novel of the same title, the screenplay by Yee, Chun Tin-nam and Lau Ho-leung plays down the book\u2019s dramatization of the cultural encounter between Western and Eastern magic. In fact, more plot similarities can be found with Neil Burger\u2019s \u201cThe Illusionist,\u201d though without that film\u2019s sustained mystique and ingenious plotting. Yin\u2019s divided affections never build to a full-blown romantic triangle; the main trio\u2019s first encounter arrives a leisurely half-hour after the scene is set and periphery characters are introduced. The midsection, in which Bully and Zhang try to suss each other out, coasts on the playful charm of the two actors, but delivers no high-concept feats. Eventually, the lead story is overtaken by inane subplots involving a lost alchemy formula, Japanese spies masquerading as filmmakers, and a Manchurian monarchist conspiracy.\nThe pic attempts to re-create the rapture of spectatorship in an era when magic appears as powerful as sorcery to a more gullible public. It works initially, such as when Zhang plays with fire or nimbly manipulates silk-screen paintings to re-enact his romantic past. However, rather than focusing on a few grand setpieces, the film features wall-to-wall magic, some of which is purely gimmicky, which inevitably strips it of mystery.\nAn exploration of magic and cinema as parallel mediums, capable of enchanting as well as deluding the masses, has as much relevance now as it did in \u201920s China, which also featured a burgeoning economy that bred unprecedented avarice and, with it, new levels of con artistry. Yee tentatively reflects on this phenomenon, but his tendency to moralize (obvious also in his \u201cProtege\u201d and \u201cShinjuku Incident\u201d) brings the film to a banal conclusion.\nPerfs are sound but not exceptional. Leung, who last graced the screen in 2009\u2019s \u201cRed Cliff II,\u201d looks a bit old for the Casanova role, and is initially rather wooden; he doesn\u2019t warm up until he\u2019s left alone to banter with Lau. Gamine Zhou easily convinces as a femme to die for, but doesn\u2019t invite deeper examination of her character or thoughts. Lau offers the most consistent turn as a wild card who keeps one guessing about his true nature until the end. Supporting turns by Wu (who had so much more presence in \u201cIp Man\u201d) and Yan (brassy as usual), plus cameos by Daniel Wu, Alex Fong and Tsui Hark, only mildly enhance the mix.\nVisual effects are refined without being tastelessly showy, and Yee Chung-man\u2019s costumes are stylishly color-coordinated with the lush decor. Production design and lighting look particularly rich and luminous, paying loving homage to the folksy northern ambience and studio-set look of Li Han-hsiang\u2019s 1970s warlord comedy-satires and trickster capers.\nStephen Tung Wai\u2019s action choreography serviceably integrates magic into martial arts, but larger-scale street fights are pedestrian.\nProduction: An Emperor Motion Picture (in Hong Kong), Bona Entertainment Co.

Why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election given the evidence that US Intelligence agencies have provided?

[That allegation from Trump is unsupported, and could well be false.] We won the electoral college by a lot. 306 to 223, I believe. [It was actually 304 to 227.] That was a well-fought battle. We did a great job.\nFrank", "baseline": "ly, I\u2019m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question. But, just to say it one time again and I say it all the time, there was no collusion. I didn\u2019t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. Every time you hear all of these 12 and 14 \u2014 it\u2019s stuff that has nothing to do \u2014 and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they are saying, well maybe that does. It doesn\u2019t. Even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories. In one case the FBI said there was no lie. There was no lie. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m president. Thank you.\nPUTIN: As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed: you can trust no one. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact.\nThere are issues where our postures diverge and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense \u2014 just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there\u2019s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That\u2019s the normal thing.\nPresident Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia/US relationship, and it\u2019s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it and different people could express their sympathy in different ways. Isn\u2019t that natural? Isn\u2019t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?\nWe heard the accusations about it. As far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn\u2019t have a fighting chance in the American courts. There\u2019s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts, not by rumors.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to the issue of this 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia. I don\u2019t know the full extent of the situation. But President Trump mentioned this issue. I will look into it.\nSo far, I can say the following. Things that are off the top of my head. We have an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The mutual assistance on criminal cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states.\nFor instance, the last year, there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. This treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer. The appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller, he can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal, official request to us so that we could interrogate, hold questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. Our enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country. They can be present at questioning.\nIn this case, there\u2019s another condition. This kind of effort should be mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate. They would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia. And we have to request the presence of our law enforcement.\nFor instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet, the money escapes the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. [He presents no evidence to back up that $400 million claim.] Well, that\u2019s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself. But the way the money was earned was illegal. We have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers guided these transactions. [This allegation, too, is merely an unsupported assertion here.] So we have an interest of questioning them. That could be a first step. We can also extend it. There are many options. They all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.\nREPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): Did you direct any of your officials to help him [Trump] do that [find those \u2018options\u2019]?\nPUTIN: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US/Russia relationship back to normal.\nThe evidence regarding that entire matter, of Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act, can be seen in the links and the other evidences that are presented in two articles that I published on that very subject, earlier this year. One, titled \u201cPrivate Investigations Find America\u2019s Magnitsky Act to Be Based on Frauds\u201d, summarizes the independently done private investigations into the evidence that is publicly available online regarding Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky Act was the basis for the first set of economic sanctions against Russia, and were instituted in 2012; so, this concerns the start of the restoration of the Cold War (without the communism etc. that were allegedly the basis of Cold War I). The other article, \u201cRussiagate-Trump Gets Solved by Giant of American Investigative Journalism\u201d, provides further details in the evidence, and connects both the Magnitsky Act and Bill Browder to the reason why, on 9 June 2016, the Russian lawyer Nataliya Veselnitskaya, met privately at Trump Tower, with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner \u2014 the reason was specifically in order to inform them about the documentation on this case, so that Trump, if elected, would be aware of the contents of those documents. She had used the promise of dirt on Hillary so as to enable Trump, who effectively became the Republican nominee on 26 May 2016, to learn about the actual documents in this crucial case.\nThe Russian government has been legally pursuing Mr. Browder, for years, on charges that he evaded paying $232 million taxes that were due to the Russian government. These private investigations into this matter \u2014 regarding whether or not the Magnitsky Act was based on fraudulent grounds \u2014 have all found that Mr. Browder has clearly falsified and misrepresented the actual documents, which are linked to in those two articles I wrote. These might be the very same documents that she was presenting on June 9th.\nSo: this is a matter of importance not only to the validity (or not) of the Magnitsky Act economic sanctions against Russia, but to the Russiagate accusations regarding U.S. President Donald Trump. In my two articles, the general public can click right through to the evidence on the Magnitsky case."}

And the Musketeers find themselves with a lot of newness as they open the Steele era.\nNo matter who was the head coach, the Musketeers would have been expected to take a step back because of the turnover from their 29-6 season. Their top three scorers were seniors Bluitt and J.P. Macura (12.9 points per game) and graduate transfer Kerem Kanter (10.9).\nWhat\u2019s left is a roster with limited experience in Xavier\u2019s system. Three graduate transfers will fill it out, but they have to get used to playing a different style.\nNEW LEADER: Goodin was among the players who lobbied for Steele to get the head coaching job, providing stability in the program. Steele is staying with Xavier\u2019s offensive and defensive systems, though tweaking them to account for the significant roster change. Goodin said Steele has kept most things the same.\nTRIO OF GRADUATE TRANSFERS: Forward Zach Hankins set school records for blocked shots and field goal percentage at Ferris State. Guard Ryan Welage set the school record for 3-pointers in three seasons at San Jose State. Guard Kyle Castlin is a team captain after coming over from Columbia, where he averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. All three are counted upon to play significant roles during their one season at Xavier.\nYOUNGER LEADERS: With no seniors who came up through Xavier\u2019s program, the Musketeers are counting on Goodin, junior Tyrique Jones, and sophomores Naji Marshall and Paul Scruggs to provide more leadership as the newcomers learn their way.\nGETTING DEFENSIVE: Xavier\u2019s defense slipped last season, often allowing teams to go on long runs that got them back into games. The perimeter defense was a problem in particular. Steele has tweaked the Musketeers\u2019 man-to-man defense to try to get more turnovers and transition baskets.\nNEW BIG EAST LOOK: The top two teams in the league have undergone significant roster changes \u2014 Xavier the regular-season champion and Villanova the national champion. With those two teams in transition, there\u2019s room for others to rise up in the league, especially in the early going."}
{"prompt": "This image from Rethink81 shows what Almond Street might look like without the Interstate 81 viaduct. The CNY Chapter of the American Institute of Architects supports demolition of the highway in favor of a Community Grid plan that would bring life and commerce into spaces now in the shadow of the interstate.\nClose your eyes and visualize a mini Park Avenue in New York City, or Millennium Park in Chicago. These urban areas are pedestrian-friendly spaces with a mix of high-rises and street-level mixed-use properties. These locations, home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world, are also critical components of a city street grid.\nThe I-81 Viaduct Project is an opportunity for our region to think big. Not a big new highway, but grand and innovative ideas on what to do with the (hopefully) soon-to-be former viaduct corridor.\nSelecting the Community Grid option over replacing the current Viaduct with a newer, bigger highway should be a \"no-brainer.\" Removing the elevated highway will open up a range of opportunities for our region; to further re", "baseline": "invigorate the city, to reconnect divided communities and to stimulate unprecedented growth.\nSyracuse was one of many cities across the country which made the fateful urban planning decision in the 1950s and 1960s to build elevated highways through their urban centers. In every case, the neighborhoods in the shadows of the viaducts suffered a similar fate; abandonment and isolation, reduced property values, pollution and noise. Beyond the socio-economic impacts on neighborhoods, city highways severely limit economic development, and they are not terribly efficient, either. Have you ever been one of the 44,000 people a day who use Exit 18 (Harrison/Adams) during the morning and evening commute?\nToday, cities like San Francisco, New Orleans, Boston, Dallas and New Haven have already, or are in the process of, tearing down elevated city highways. In Milwaukee, where the Park East Freeway was razed in 1999, urban development has flourished with property values in the affected area increasing by 45 percent. In 2007, Manpower relocated its 900-employee global headquarters to a site in downtown Milwaukee formerly occupied by elevated the highway.\nThis can happen in Syracuse.\nThe economics favor the Community Grid option as well. The Grid costs $400 million less than the Viaduct, which also takes longer to build and requires increasing annual maintenance costs over the next 50-plus years. Equally important, the Community Grid stimulates economic growth. There is a need to re-densify the city, especially in walkable areas like those around Almond Avenue. Walkable zones attract people and development generating sales and property tax revenue. We have an opportunity to revitalize the valuable areas currently shadowed by I-81.\nIn addition to the community-building and economic development benefits, there are compelling logistics arguments for the Community Grid. Eighty-eight percent of the traffic on the existing viaduct consists of people travelling to the city - most for work. The current highway, however, is designed to help cars bypass the city altogether.\nThe Community Grid design taps into the existing infrastructure, dispersing traffic throughout the city grid by promoting broader use of the existing underutilized street network. The design provides direct connections to key destinations in the city and adds new exits to ease congestion and further spread traffic. In the grid, instead of one path to their destination, drivers will have multiple access points.\nThe grid design is also the least disruptive option, requiring the acquisition of just five buildings. The construction of a new Viaduct will condemn and demolish 24 buildings, including at least 12 structures of historical significance.\nThe American Institute of Architects Central New York chapter created the AIACNY81 Task Force in 2013 to carefully follow this process; to help broaden community knowledge and promote good design and planning practices. Based on our review of the current plans, we strongly recommend the Community Grid alternative, which would knit the city together again and offer unprecedented redevelopment potential.\nFor this process to be truly successful we must view this as more than just fixing a mistake, or designing a better traffic pattern. The Community Grid presents an urban development opportunity which will have a profound effect on our region for generations.\nSyracuse, Central New York and New York state must maximize this opportunity. Let's get this right with big ideas not a big new highway. We look forward to being an integral part of this important planning conversation."}

Glover is a communications officer for the Veteran Integrated Services Network 9, which includes the Memphis VA Medical Center.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center is now scrambling, asking dozens to work over-time in order to clear up the back log, and the VA police are investigating the source of the leak to TheDC, the whistle-blower noted.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center cares deeply for every veteran we are privileged to serve.

{"prompt": "Proclus of Athens (*412\u2013485 C.E.) was the most authoritative philosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages. For almost fifty years, he was head or \u2018successor\u2019 (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic \u2018Academy\u2019 in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive writer, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato, systematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at that time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics, ethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom (Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on the development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens, but also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of the school. In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic philosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions of wisdom. Continuing a movement that was", "baseline": "inaugurated by Iamblichus (4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and following the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate the harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of Homer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and to integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and Plato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology offers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic theology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus\u2019 philosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly commentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into the Neoplatonic metaphysical system.\nSince Proclus\u2019 extant works contain almost no evidence about his biography, we have to rely on the information transmitted by his direct pupil Marinus of Neapolis in the eulogy he devoted to his predecessor Proclus or on Happiness. Moreover, some scattered remarks on Proclus and valuable information about the schools in Athens and Alexandria can be found in Damascius\u2019 Life of Isidorus (called by other scholars The Philosophical History). As with Porphyry\u2019s Life of Plotinus, both Marinus\u2019 and Damascius\u2019 works are biographies written by students praising extensively the achievements of their teachers both in doctrine and in philosophical life.\nOn Proclus\u2019 works see Beutler (1957), 190\u2013208, Saffrey-Westerink (1968), lv\u2013lx, Ros\u00e1n (\u00b22009), 266\u2013274, and especially Luna\u2013Segonds\u2013Endress (2012), as well as the short overview given below (1.2). Although a large part of his numerous writings is lost, some major commentaries on Plato have survived (though incomplete) and some important systematic works. Moreover, later Neoplatonists such as Damascius, Olympiodorus, Simplicius, and Philoponus have conserved many extracts of lost work, but these fragments have never been collected (see now, however, Luna\u2013Segonds\u2013Endress (2012)).\nProclus was born in Constantinople/Byzantium (now Istanbul) into a rich Lycian family in 412. Not long after his birth his parents returned to their hometown Xanthos in Lycia, a maritime area of what is now southwest Turkey. He began his education in Xanthos and moved from there to Alexandria (Egypt) to pursue the study of rhetoric in order to become a lawyer, as was his father. However, during a journey to Byzantium he discovered philosophy as his vocation. Back in Alexandria he studied Aristotle and mathematics. Marinus reports that the very gifted pupil easily learned all of Aristotle\u2019s logical writings by heart.\nIn 430\u2013431, 18 years old, Proclus moved to Athens, attracted by the fame of the Platonic School there. He studied for two years under the direction of Plutarch (of Athens; to be distinguished from the 1st\u20132nd c. philosopher/biographer), reading with him Plato\u2019s Phaedo and Aristotle\u2019s De anima. After Plutarch\u2019s death in 432, Syrianus became the head of the Academy. Proclus followed with him the usual curriculum of the school (going back to Iamblichus), reading first Aristotle\u2019s works and after that entering the \u2018greater mysteries,\u2019 the Platonic dialogues. Under Syrianus, Proclus also came into contact with the older traditions of wisdom such as the theology of the Orphics and the Chaldaean Oracles. Among Syrianus\u2019 lost works we find a treatise On the harmony of Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato with the Chaldaean Oracles. As the Suda lexicon attributes a work with this title also to Proclus, it is not unlikely that he published Syrianus\u2019 treatise, adding comments of his own. Since Syrianus and Proclus worked intensively together for six years, Proclus was strongly influenced by his teacher. On many occasions Proclus praises the philosophical achievements of his teacher and he never criticizes him. Because of this, it is almost impossible to distinguish between Proclus\u2019 original contribution and what he adopted from Syrianus.\nAfter Syrianus\u2019 death (437), Proclus succeeded as head of the Athenian school, and he kept this position for almost fifty years until his death in 485. His tight schedule of the day, starting with a prayer to the sun at sunrise (repeated at noontime and at sunset), included lectures, reading seminars, discussions with students, and literary work of his own. Besides his philosophical activities, Marinus also portrays Proclus as an experienced practitioner of theurgy (Life of Proclus, \u00a7 28\u201329; on theurgy see below 3.6). The practice of these pagan rites could only be continued in the private sphere of the School\u2019s grounds. Though Proclus was in Athens a highly respected philosopher and had some Christian students, he had to be prudent to avoid anti-pagan reactions. Marinus tells that he had to go into exile for about one year to Lydia (in Asia) to avoid difficulties (Life of Proclus \u00a7 15).\nMarinus notes that Proclus was an extremely industrious writer, having an \u201cunbounded love of work\u201d (Life of Proclus \u00a7 22). Apart from an impressive teaching-load and several other commitments, Proclus wrote every day about 700 lines (about 20\u201325 pages). It is unlikely that Proclus published all of them. However that may be, from Proclus\u2019 extant works and the information about his lost works it emerges that he was a productive writer indeed. Roughly two thirds of Proclus\u2019 output is now lost and several works, especially his commentaries on Plato, have been transmitted in a mutilated form.\nProclus\u2019 Works (the main extant works).\nIt is difficult to establish a chronology of Proclus\u2019 works. The Platonic Theology is generally considered to be his last work. In writing the Theology Proclus heavily depends on his interpretation of the Parmenides and often refers to his commentary on this dialogue, which must have been finished some time before. We know from Marinus (Life of Proclus \u00a713) that Proclus finished his Commentary on the Timaeus by the age of 27. However, it cannot be excluded that Proclus rewrote or modified it later. As the Alcibiades came at the beginning of the curriculum in the school, its commentary may also be an early work. The Commentary on the Republic is not a proper commentary, but a collection of several essays on problems and sections in this dialogue. These essays may have been written at different times in Proclus\u2019 life and only later put together (by Proclus himself or by someone else). The Hypotyp\u00f4sis (Exposition of Astronomical Hypotheses) was written in the year after Proclus\u2019 exile in Lydia, but we do not know when exactly that took place. The Tria opuscula all deal with similar topics, but they need not have been composed at the same time. There are plausible arguments to put the second treatise, On What Depends on Us, some years after the events forcing Proclus to go into exile. The first treatise, which in some parts depends very much on Plutarch (of Chaironea, 1st\u20132nd c. C.E.), could be set earlier in his career. It also contains a discussion on the nature of evil, which is much simpler than what we find in the treatise On the Existence of Evils, which is more sophisticated and probably was composed later. Because of its introductory character, one may be inclined to consider the Elements of Physics as an early work. This has also been claimed for the Elements of Theology, which, however, shows all the sophistication of Proclus\u2019s mature thought. It may be possible that Proclus revised this text several times in his career.\nThe center of Proclus\u2019 extensive oeuvre is without doubt his exegesis of Plato, as is shown by the large commentaries he devoted to major dialogues. This Platonic focus is also evident in the composition of his systematic works. The Platonic Theology offers a systematic exposition of theology based on an interpretation of all relevant sections on the gods and their attributes in Plato\u2019s dialogues, and in particular on the Parmenides, considered as the most theological of all dialogues. Proclus probably commented on all dialogues included in the curriculum of the school since Iamblichus. In addition Proclus wrote the commentary on the Republic mentioned above. The curriculum consisted of altogether 12 dialogues distributed into two cycles. The first cycle started with Alcibiades (on self-knowledge) and ended with the Philebus (on the final cause of everything: the good), comprising two dialogues on ethics (the Gorgias and the Phaedo), two on logic (the Cratylus and the Theaetetus), two on physics (the Sophist and the Statesman), and two on theology (the Phaedrus and the Symposium). The second cycle included the two perfect dialogues that were considered to encompass Plato\u2019s whole philosophy (In Tim. I 13.14\u201317), namely, the Timaeus (on physics) and the Parmenides (on theology).\nIn the form and method of his commentaries, Proclus is again influenced by Iamblichus. He assumes that each Platonic dialogue must have one main theme (skopos) to which all parts of the arguments ought to be related. To interpret the text, different approaches are possible (theological, mathematical, physical, ethical exegesis), but they are all interconnected according to the principle \u2018everything in everything\u2019 (panta en pasin). Thus, the Timaeus has in all its parts as its purpose the explanation of nature (physiologia). Even the introductory sections, the summary of the discussion in the Republic and the anticipation of the story about Atlantis, must be understood from this point of view; for they contain, in the mode of \u2018images and examples,\u2019 a description of the fundamental forces that are at work in the physical world. Also the long treatise on human nature, which concludes Timaeus\u2019 exposition, has ultimately a cosmological meaning, as the human animal is a microcosmos wherein all elements and all causes of the great universe are found. More problematic was the determination of the skopos of the Parmenides. In a long discussion with the whole hermeneutical tradition since middle-Platonism, Proclus defends a theological interpretation of the dialogue. According to him, the dialectical discussion on the One and the Many (ta alla) reveals the first divine principles of all things.\nWith the exception of the commentary on the Cratylus, of which only a selection of notes from the original commentary is preserved, the exegetical works of Proclus have a clear structure. They divide the Platonic text in different lemmata or cited passages, discussing first the doctrine exposed in the particular section (pragmata, later called theoria), next commenting on the formulation of the argument (called lexis) [see Festugi\u00e8re 1963]. Whereas modern scholars usually accept a development in Plato\u2019s thought and distinguish between an early, middle, and late Plato, the Neoplatonists take the Platonic corpus as the expression of a divinely inspired and unitary philosophical doctrine. This enables them to connect different Platonic dialogues into one system and to see numerous cross-references within the Platonic oeuvre. What may seem to be contradictions between statements made in different dialogues, can be explained by different pedagogical contexts, some dialogues being rather maieutic than expository, some elenctic of the sophistic pseudo-science, some offering a dialectical training to young students.\nA Neoplatonic commentary offers much more than a faithful interpretation of an authoritative text of Plato. Plato\u2019s text gives the commentator an opportunity to develop his own views on the most fundamental philosophical questions, the first principles, the idea of the Good, the doctrine of the Forms, the soul and its faculties, nature, etc. As was said, the two culminating dialogues, the Timaeus and the Parmenides, offer together a comprehensive view of the whole of Platonic philosophy.\nThe interpretation of the Parmenides thus prepares the way for the Platonic Theology, offering the systematic structure for a scientific demonstration of the procession of all the orders of gods from the first principle. As Proclus explains at Theol. Plat. I 2, p. 9.8\u201319, the Platonic Theology falls into three parts (after a long methodological introduction). The first part (Theol. Plat. I 13\u201329) is an investigation into the common notions (koinai ennoiai) of the gods as we find them in Plato\u2019s dialogues: it is a treatise on the divine names and attributes. The second part (Theol. Plat. II\u2013VI), which is incomplete, unfolds in a systematic way the procession of the divine hierarchies, from the One, that is the first god, to the \u2018higher kinds,\u2019 i.e., angels, daimones, and heroes, while the third part, which is altogether missing, was supposed to deal with the individual hypercosmic and encosmic gods.\nFollowing Plato, Aristotle explains in his Physics the general principles of natural things: form, matter, nature, the essence and principles of movement, time and place; again taking inspiration from the Timaeus, he studies in other works the specific principles of the distinct regions of the physical world, thus in the De Caelo the celestial and the sublunary realm, and in On generation and corruption and in Meteorologica the sublunary realm. In this domain, it cannot be denied, Aristotle did much more than his master. According to Proclus, however, he developed the subject \u2018beyond what is needed\u2019. The same remark must be made about Aristotle\u2019s extensive zoological research. Whereas Plato limited himself in the Timaeus to an analysis of the fundamental principles of all living organisms, Aristotle gave most of his attention to the material components of animals and scarcely, and only in few cases, did he consider the organism from the perspective of the form. Plato, on the contrary, when explaining the physical world, never got lost in a detailed examination.\nWhen trying to determine Proclus\u2019 profile as a philosopher, one has to keep in mind that Platonists were not keen on introducing new elements into the Platonic doctrine. They despised innovation (kainotomia). Yet it cannot be denied that Neoplatonic philosophy differs considerably from what we read in Plato\u2019s dialogues. There is also overwhelming evidence for continual discussions in the school on the right interpretation of Plato or on certain doctrinal points (such as the transcendence of the One, or the question whether the soul wholly descended from the intelligible world). In order to evaluate Proclus\u2019 originality, one ought to compare his views with those of the Neoplatonists before him, such as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus. Only with regard to Plotinus is this possible to a great extent, because we still have the full corpus of Plotinus\u2019 writings. Proclus certainly admired the first \u2018founder\u2019 of the new Platonism and even devoted a commentary to the Enneads, of which, alas, we have only some fragments. He shared Plotinus\u2019 views on the three principal hypostases the One, the Intellect and the Soul, and often uses language inspired by his reading of Plotinus, as in his description of the union of the soul with the ineffable One. Yet on many points, he is very critical of Plotinus, pointing to contradictions, rejecting provocative views such as the thesis that One is cause of itself (causa sui), the doctrine of the undescended soul, or the identification of evil with matter. Another radical difference from Plotinus (and Porphyry) is the importance attributed to theurgy for the salvation of the soul and the authority of Chaldaean Oracles.\nAs said before, it is very difficult to mark off Proclus\u2019 originality with regard to his teacher Syrianus, the only predecessor he never criticizes. Of the literary production of the latter, we have only his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. It is possible that most of Syrianus\u2019 courses on Plato never were published, but were continued and further worked out by Proclus himself. We have, however, the commentary on the Phaedrus by Hermeias, who was sitting together with Proclus, in Syrianus\u2019 course. One gets the impression that Syrianus was very interested in Orphic theogony, whereas for Proclus the Chaldaean Oracles are more authoritative when developing a Platonic theology. But here again, it is difficult to compare as we do not possess Proclus\u2019 own commentary. Is Proclus after all then not so original, but only an excellent teacher and wonderful systematizer of the new Platonic doctrines which became dominant in the school since Iamblichus on? We shall never know, and it is after all not so important when assessing the philosophical merits of his works. To praise Proclus\u2019 philosophical achievements, Marinus devotes in Life of Proclus one chapter to the discussion of the doctrines we owe to him (\u00a7 23). Surprisingly, for all his admiration for the master, he can only enumerate a few innovative doctrines; and they are of such a minor importance that we shall not even discuss them in this article.\nIn late antiquity, Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics was considered to be a theological work, because Aristotle investigates in this treatise the first principles of all being.\nIndeed, there is precedent for this in Aristotle himself, for in Metaphysics VI, 1, 1026a15ff, he classifies \u201cfirst philosophy,\u201d or metaphysics, as theology.\nProclus himself often uses the term \u2018theology\u2019 in this metaphysical sense for the study of the first (\u2018divine\u2019) principles of all things. His Elements of Theology can in fact be considered an introduction to his metaphysics. The work is a concatenated demonstration of 217 propositions, which may be divided into two halves: the first 112 propositions establish the One, unity without any multiplicity, as the ultimate cause of reality and lay down basic metaphysical concepts/structures such as causality, participation, the relation of wholes to parts, infinity, and eternity. The second half deals with the three kinds of true causes within reality recognized by Proclus: gods (which he calls henads or \u201cunities,\u201d see below), intellects, and souls. This elaborate metaphysical framework makes it possible for Proclus to develop a scientific theology, i.e., a demonstration of the procession and properties of the different classes of gods. In what follows we will only discuss some characteristic features of Proclus\u2019 metaphysics (see further Steel 2011).\nOn the whole, Proclus\u2019 doctrine of first principles is a further development of Plotinus\u2019 innovative interpretation of Platonic philosophy. With Plotinus, Proclus recognizes three fundamental levels of reality called \u2018hypostases\u2019 (or self-subsistent entities): One, Intellect, and Soul. However, following a concern of his predecessor Iamblichus for greater precision in the relationship and distinction between the One and Intellect, Proclus distinguishes between the intelligible Being (to no\u00eaton\u2014what is the object of intellectual intuition) and the intellective (to noeron\u2014what is intelligizing), and introduces between both, as an intermediary level, the no\u00eaton-noeron (what is being intelligized and intelligizing). These three ontological levels thus correspond to the triad of Being, Life, and Intellect, which already play an important role in Plotinus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s speculations about the procession or \u2018emanation\u2019 of the intelligible world from the One, without, however, being hypostasized. Since Zeller (influenced by Hegel) the application of the triadic structure to reality has been seen as the characteristic feature of Proclus\u2019 system, but see Dodds 19632, pp. xxii and 220, on possible sources of the doctrine.\nAnother fundamental triad is the triad Unparticipated-Participated-Participating (amethekton-metechomenon-metechon). Plato\u2019s theory of participation, which explains the relation between the intelligible world and the sensible reality it grounds, raised many problems, several of which Plato himself brings up in the first part of his Parmenides. Most pressing was the puzzle: How can a Form be at the same time one and the same and exist as a whole in many participants? (see Plato, Parmenides 131a-b). The basic idea of the triad of participation, which can also be seen as responding to Aristotle\u2019s criticism of participation, is to maintain the transcendence, and hence, the unity of the Form, while allowing for its presence in the participants. Thanks to the existence of an \u2018unparticipated\u2019 principle, that is, one that is not such as to be participated in by anything, to which the \u2018participated\u2019 entities, the ones that are participated in by something, are connected by means of \u201cthe triad of triads\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 23), the universal nature of the Form can be safeguarded.\nProclus, however, also applies this principle to explain the most difficult problem facing Neoplatonic metaphysics, namely, how to understand the procession of the manifold from the One. How can the One be wholly without multiplicity, when it must somehow be the cause of any and all multiplicity? The One remains in itself absolutely unparticipated; the many different beings proceeding from it participate in a series of participated henads or unities (gods). According to some scholars it was Iamblichus who introduced this innovative doctrine, others attribute it to Proclus\u2019 teacher Syrianus. Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from Iamblichus himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows from his law of mean terms. This law states that \u201cevery producing cause brings into existence things like to itself before the unlike.\u201c (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 28). Thus there are no leaps in the chain of being, but everything is linked together by similar terms. The henads fulfill this function, for as participated unities they bridge the gap between the transcendent One and everything that comes after it. The doctrine of the henads can thus be seen as a way of integrating the traditional gods of Greek polytheistic religion into the Neoplatonic metaphysics of the One.\na. Auxiliary and true causes. From Middle Platonism onwards, various attempts were made to integrate the Aristotelian doctrine of causes within the Platonic philosophy (see Steel 2003). In Plato\u2019s work, it was argued, one can find the four types of causality that Aristotle distinguishes, to wit formal, material, efficient, final, and, besides, the paradigmatic cause, which Aristotle wrongly rejected. This system of causes (with the addition of the instrumental cause as a sixth) became standard in later Neoplatonism. In his commentary on the Timaeus, Proclus observes that Aristotle never rises to the proper level of causality. For the four causes, as Aristotle understands them, can only be applied to the explanation of processes in the sublunary world. In the Platonic view, however, the material and formal causes are only subservient or instrumental causes. Those causes are in fact immanent in their effects and constitutive elements of the thing they produce. As Proclus asserts in prop. 75 of the Elements of Theology, \u201cthat which exists in the effect is not so much a cause as an auxiliary cause (sunaition) or an instrument of the producer.\u201d Causes in the proper sense must act upon their effects from outside, while transcending them. For a proper understanding of what the true causes are of all things, Proclus argues, one must follow Plato, who lifts us up to the level of the transcendent Forms and makes us discover the creative causality of the demiurge and the finality of the Good as the ultimate explanation of all aspirations.\nAlthough Aristotle also discusses efficient and final causes, he falls short of a true understanding of creative causality because he abandons the hypothesis of the Forms. Without the transcendent Forms, there can be no explanation of the being of things, only an explanation of their movement and change. Given Aristotle\u2019s narrow understanding of nature, it must come as no surprise, Proclus notices, that he admits of cases of \u2018spontaneous generation\u2019 in the sublunary realm, which again restricts the purport of efficient causality. Moreover, because of his rejection of the demiurge (and of the One), Aristotle is also forced to limit efficient causality to the sublunary realm. In fact, in his view there is no cause of existence of the celestial bodies or of the sensible world as a whole: they exist necessarily in all eternity. But, as Proclus argues, such a position will force him to admit that the world has the capacity to constitute itself, which is absurd (see below).\nThe Neoplatonic concept of causality is therefore quite different from that of the Peripatetics, even if both share the same terminology, such as final or efficient cause. Aristotle\u2019s causes are primarily intended to explain how things move and change, come to be and cease to be, but also offer to explain what given things are. For the Neoplatonists, generalizing a principle formulated in the Philebus \u2014 \u201cthat everything that comes to be comes to be through a cause\u201d (26e, cf. Tim. 28a) \u2014 causality is of much wider application than the explanation of change and motion, it is not only about what things are, but about what constitutes (hupostatikos) their being, and it can be, analogously, used to explain relations between all levels of being. Thus we can say of the One that it is the cause of Intellect, and of Intellect that it is cause of Soul. In the Timaeus, however, the main interest is to understand what is the cause of the sensible world and all the cosmic beings: this is primarily the demiurge or creator of the world (the One is not the \u2018creator\u2019 of Intellect).\nEvery body has by its own nature the capacity to be acted upon, every incorporeal thing the capacity to act, the former being in itself inactive, the latter impassive; but through association with the body, the incorporeal too is acted upon, just as bodies too can act because of the participation in incorporeal entities.\nIn this proposition Proclus first sets apart the corporeal and incorporeal as being active/impassible and passive/inactive respectively. However, the two realms are not absolutely separate from each other. The soul, which is an incorporeal substance, enters into association with the body and thus becomes itself, though only accidentally, subject to different passions. The body, on the contrary, may gain great profit from the association with the incorporeal. This is evident in the case of animated bodies, which owe all their vital activities to the presence of the soul in them. But also inanimate natural bodies acquire all capacities and powers from nature and its inherent logoi or organizing rational principles (see Steel 2002).\nc. The relation of cause to its effect. The relation between a cause and its effect is characterized by both similarity and dissimilarity. For every cause produces something that is similar to it, and every effect thus resembles its cause, though in a secondary and less perfect way. But in so far as the effect is really distinguished from its cause, it acquires its own characteristic form of being, which was not yet developed on the level of its cause. For this reason each thing can be said to exist in three manners (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 65). First, it is in itself as expressing formally its own character (kath\u2019 hyparxin). Second, it exists in a causal manner (kat\u2019 aitian) being anticipated in its cause. Finally, it exists as being participated (kata methexin) by the next level of being, which is its effect. Thus life is a property of a living organism as being participated by it. Life characterizes the soul formally. Life also exists qua Form in the divine mind. Finally, Proclus stresses that the higher a cause, the more comprehensive it is, and the further its effects reach (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 57). All things, including matter, which has in itself, apart from the forms existing in it, no \u2018being\u2019, participate in the One; all beings participate in Being; all plants and animals participate in Life; all rational souls participate in Intellect.\nProclus\u2019 epistemology is firmly rooted in his theory of the soul. For Proclus, souls as self-moving principles represent the lowest level of entities that are capable of reverting upon itself (so called self-constituted beings [authypostata], see Elem. Theol. \u00a7 40\u201351). They are incorporeal, separable from bodies and indestructible/immortal (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 186\u20137). Yet, they are principles of life and of movement of bodies (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 188). In accordance with Proclus\u2019 general metaphysical principles (cf. above 3.1), from the unparticipated soul-monad proceed different kinds of participated soul: divine souls, daemonic souls, human souls, souls of animals). As with other Platonists, Proclus frequently discusses the vexed question as to why a soul would descend into a body at all (\u2018fall of the soul\u2019) (see D\u00f6rrie / Baltes (2002.2) 163\u2013218). Moreover, the Neoplatonist distinguishes between altogether three so-called vehicles (och\u00eamata) of the soul. The rational soul is permanently housed in the luminous vehicle, while the non-rational soul is located in the pneumatic vehicle. By being incarnated in a human body, soul, or rather, the vegetative soul attains thus a (third) \u2018shell-like\u2019 vehicle. The theory of the different vehicles or the psychic \u2018astral body,\u2019 familiar nowadays from modern theosophic theories, fulfils several crucial functions in Neoplatonic psychology: it explains (a) how an incorporeal soul can be linked to a body, (b) how souls can move in space, (c) how souls can be punished after death (cf. Plato\u2019s myths), (d) where certain faculties of the soul such as imagination are located. Proclus distinguishes between two kinds of vehicles, one mortal and the other immortal (In Tim. III 236.31 ff. and Elem. Theol. \u00a7 207\u2013210). Proclus also adheres to the Platonic theory of transmigration, but argues that human souls never enter animal bodies as their constitutive forms. For only animal souls can be organizing principles of animal bodies. If some rational souls are \u2018degraded\u2019 in the next life and forced to live in an animal body because of their misdemeanour in this life, they are only \u2018relationally\u2019 (schesei) present to this animal body.\nProclus distinguishes between the following faculties of soul: sense perception, imagination (phantasia), opinion, discursive thought, and intellection. While sense perception and imagination belong to the non-rational soul, opinion forms the lowest level of rationality. The aim of epistemological ascent is to free oneself eventually from the lower psychic faculties, including the lower rational ones, in order to enjoy a state of pure contemplation.\nAs with many other Platonists, Proclus\u2019 epistemology is based on a theory of innate knowledge (in accordance with the Platonic dictum that \u2018all learning is recollection [anamn\u00easis]\u2019). Proclus refers to the innate contents of the soul as its reason-principles (logoi) or Forms (eid\u00ea). These innate reason-principles constitute the essence of soul. That is why they are called \u2018essential reason-principles\u2019 (logoi ousi\u00f4deis) (Steel 1997). The traditional translation reason-principles was chosen on purpose, because on an ontological level these same logoi serve as principles of all things. They are extended or unfolded images of the Forms that exist in intellect; and by means of them the world-soul with the assistance of Nature brings forth everything. In other words, the psychic logoi are instantiations of Platonic Forms on the level of soul as are the logoi in Nature and the forms immanent in matter. According to the fundamental Neoplatonic axiom panta en pasin (\u2018all things are in all things\u2019), Forms exist on all levels of reality. But the logoi in soul also offer the principles of all knowledge and are the starting points of demonstration. At In Parm. IV 894.3\u201318 (ed. Steel) Proclus argues that only with reference to these notions within the soul predication is possible (see Helmig 2008), since they are universal in the true sense of the word. On the other hand, both transcendent Platonic Forms and forms in matter are not taken to be universals proper by Proclus. The former are rather intelligible particulars, as it were, and cannot be defined (Steel 2004), while the latter are strictly speaking instantiated or individualised universals that are not shared by many particulars (see Helmig 2008, cf. above 3.1\u20132). For this reason, it does not make much sense to talk about \u2018the problem of universals\u2019 in Proclus.\nIt is another crucial assumption of Proclus\u2019 epistemology that all souls share the same logoi (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 194\u2013195). In terms of concept-formation this entails that psychic concepts, once they are grasped correctly, are universal, objective, and shareable (see Helmig (2012) 13\u201324). Moreover, if all souls share the same logoi, and these logoi are the principles of reality (see above), then by grasping the logoi souls come to know the true principles or causes of reality. Already Aristotle had written that to know something signifies to know its cause (Met. A 3, 983a25\u201326 and An. Post. I 2, 71b9\u201312). In his Commentary on Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Proclus introduces an interesting distinction. Taking his start from the problem of how we can recognise certain objects, he considers the example of an apple. The different senses tell us that there is something sweet, red, even, with a nice smell. And while common sense (koin\u00ea aisth\u00easis) can distinguish the different impressions of the special senses, only opinion (doxa) is capable of saying that the object there on the table is an apple. Doxa is able to do this, because it has access to the innate logoi of the soul. However, as Proclus explains (In Tim. I 248.11 ff.), opinion only knows the \u2018that\u2019 (hoti), that is, it can recognize objects. Discursive thought (dianoia), on the other hand, also knows the \u2018why\u2019 (dihoti), that is, the causes of something. This distinction can also be rephrased in terms of concepts, implying a distinction between factual concepts that allow us to identify or recognise certain objects, and concepts that fulfil an explanatory role. On the whole, Proclus\u2019 reading and systematisation of Plato\u2019s doctrine of learning as recollection makes Platonic recollection not only concerned with higher learning, since already on the level of object recognition we employ concepts that originate from the innate logoi of the soul (Helmig (2012) 299\u2013333).\nProclus argues at length that the human soul has to contain innate knowledge. Therefore, one should not consider it an empty writing tablet, as Aristotle does (Aristotle, De anima III 4). He is wrong in asserting that the soul contains all things potentially. According to Proclus, the soul contains all things (i.e., all logoi) in actuality, though due to the \u2018shock of birth\u2019 it may seem as if the soul has fallen to potentiality. At In Crat. \u00a7 61, Proclus asserts that the soul does not resemble an empty writing tablet (agraphon grammateion) and does not possess all things in potentiality, but in act. In Eucl. 16.8\u201313 expresses the same idea: \u201cthe soul is not a writing tablet void of logoi, but it is always written upon and always writing itself and being written on by the intellect.\u201d As with his philosophy of mathematics, Proclus presents a detailed criticism of the view that universal concepts are derived from sensible objects (by abstraction, induction, or collection). In the fourth book of his Commentary on Plato\u2019s Parmenides and in the two prologues of the Commentary on Euclid we find the most comprehensive criticism of abstractionism in antiquity (see Helmig (2010) and (2012) 205\u2013221).\nProclus devoted three entire books or \u2018monographs\u2019 (monobiblia) to problems of providence, fate, free choice, and evil. The first treatise (Ten problems concerning providence) examines ten different problems on providence that were commonly discussed in the Platonic school. For Proclus providence (pronoia) is the beneficent activity of the first principle (the \u2018source of goods\u2019) and the gods (henads), who have their existence before intellect (pro-nou). One of the problems discussed is the question of how divine foreknowledge and human free choice can be reconciled. For if god knows not only past and present, but also future events, the outcome of future events is already pre-determined (as god has a determinate knowledge of all things), and hence there is no free choice for humans. Proclus\u2019 answer, which ultimately goes back to Iamblichus, consists in applying the principle that the mode of knowledge is not conditioned by the object known but by the knower. In the case of gods, this entails that they know the contingent event in a non contingent manner, the mutable immutably. They have an undivided knowledge of things divided and a timeless knowledge of things temporal (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 124, cf. De decem dub. \u00a7 6\u20138). Proclus\u2019 answer was later taken up by Ammonius in his Commentary on the De Interpretatione IX and in Boethius\u2019 Consolation of Philosophy V 6 as well as in his Commentary on the De Interpretatione IX.\nThese three distinctions taken together make it possible for Proclus to ultimately reconcile providence, fate, and free choice. In so far as we are rational agents and let ourselves being determined in our choices only by intelligible principles, we may transcend the determinism of fate to which we belong as corporeal beings. Yet, our actions are integrated into the providential order, as we willingly obey the divine principles.\nThe third treatise (On the existence of evils) asks why and how evil can exist if the world is governed by divine providence. Proclus argues that evil does not have an existence of its own, but only a derivative or parasitic existence (par-hypostasis, sc. on the good) (De mal. \u00a7 50).\nDionysius the Areopagite adopted Proclus\u2019 views on evil in his work On the Divine Names. Thanks to this adaptation Proclus\u2019 doctrine of evil had an enormous influence on the later medieval discussions on evil both in Byzantium and in the Latin West and dominated the philosophical debates on evil up to the 19th century.\nBefore offering an explanation of the generation of the world, Timaeus sets out the fundamental principles that will govern his whole explanation of the physical world (Tim. 27d5\u201328b5). As Proclus observes, it is the task of a scientist to formulate at the start of his project the principles proper to the science in question, and not just to assume some general axioms. The science of nature too is based on specific axioms and assumptions, which must be clarified before we can move to the demonstration. In order to make phusiologia a real science, the philosopher must deduce his explanation, as does the geometer, from a set of fundamental propositions or axioms.\nStarting from these fundamental propositions, Proclus argues, Plato deduces the different types of causality that are required for a truly scientific understanding of nature (efficient, exemplary, and final cause; see Steel 2003 and above 3.2).\nProclus discusses eternity and time in his commentary on the Timaeus and in propositions 53\u201355 of the Elements of Theology (see Steel 2001). Aristotle had defined time as a \u201cmeasure of movement according to the before and after.\u201d Therefore, anything measured by time must have a form of existence or activity in which a past and a future state can be distinguished. In fact, an entity in time is never wholly and simultaneously what it is, but has an existence extended in a process of before and after. Opposed to it stands the eternal, which exists as a simultaneous whole and admits of no composition or change. \u201cThere is no part of it,\u201d writes Proclus, \u201cwhich has already subsisted and another that will subsist later, but as yet is not. All that it is capable of being, already possesses it in entirety without losing it or without accumulating\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 52). One must distinguish the temporality of things in process from the time by which they are measured. Temporal things participate in time, without being time. \u201cTime exists prior to all things in time\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 53).\nWith Iamblichus, Proclus distinguishes absolute time, which is not participated in and exists \u2018prior\u2019 to all temporal things, from participated time, or rather the many participated times. The same distinctions must also be made regarding eternity. For Eternity precedes as cause and measures the multiple eternal beings that participate in it. \u201cEvery Eternity is a measure of things eternal, every Time of things in time; and these two are the only measures of life and movement in things\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 54). To conclude, there are two measures of the duration of things. First there is eternity, which measures at once the whole duration of a being. Second, there is time, which measures piecemeal the extension of a being that continually passes from one state to another. Eternity can be seen as the prefiguration of time; time as the image of eternity. Each of them governs a separate sphere of reality, eternity the intelligible being, time the temporal (corporeal and psychic) world of change.\nNotwithstanding the sharp distinction between the temporal and the eternal realm, there are beings that share in both eternity and time. As Proclus notes in the corollary to Elem. Theol. \u00a7 55, \u201cof the things which exist in time, some have a perpetual duration.\u201d Thus the universe as a whole and the celestial spheres in it are both eternal and temporal. They are eternal because they never come to existence in time and never will cease to exist. But they are temporal because they possess their being only through a process of change in a sequence of moments. The same holds true for the psychic realm: all souls are immortal and indestructible; nevertheless, they are continually undergoing change. Therefore, as Proclus says, \u201c\u2018perpetuity\u2019 (aidiot\u00eas) is of two kinds, the one eternal (ai\u00f4nion), the other in time; [\u2026] the one having its being concentrated in a simultaneous whole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension (paratasis); the one entire in itself, the other composed of parts, each of which exists separately in a sequence of prior and posterior.\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 55, trans. Dodds, modified).\nAgainst Aristotle\u2019s critique in De Caelo I 10, Proclus defends the view that the cosmos is \u201cboth eternal and generated (gen\u00eatos).\u201d As a corporeal being, the universe cannot produce itself and maintain itself in being. It depends for its existence upon a superior cause, and it is for that reason \u201cgenerated.\u201d This does not prevent it, however, from existing for ever, in an infinite time. As we just saw, Proclus distinguishes between what is eternal in an absolute sense (the intelligible realm) and what is eternal because it continues to exist for the whole of time, what Boethius later called \u201caevum\u201d in distinction from \u201caeternum.\u201d As Proclus notices, at the end of the Physics (8.10, 266a27\u201328), Aristotle himself establishes that no body can possess from itself an unlimited power to exist. If the world exists eternally, it must have this power from an incorporeal principle. Therefore, Aristotle too is forced to admit that the world is somehow generated, though it continues to exist for eternity. For it always receives from its cause its infinite power and never possesses it at once as a whole, because it is limited. The world is eternal, because it has an infinite power of coming to be, not because it exists of infinite power (In Tim. I 252.11\u2013254.18).\nRelated to the eternity of the world is the question of the nature of the celestial bodies. Aristotle argues in De Caelo I 2 that the celestial bodies, which move with a natural circular motion, must be made of a simple substance different from the four sublunary simple bodies (whose natural movements are in a straight line: up or down). This \u2018fifth element,\u2019 which is by nature imperishable, is the ether. With this explanation Aristotle seems to oppose the view Plato defends in Timaeus where it is said that the Demiurge made the divine celestial bodies \u201cmostly out of fire\u201d (40a2\u20134). Proclus admits that the heaven is composed out of the four elements with a preponderance of fire, but he insists that the elements are not present in the celestial bodies in the same mode as they exist in the sublunary bodies. Therefore Aristotle is right when he considers the heavens to constitute a fifth nature besides the four elements. \u201cFor in the heavens the elements are not the same as they are here, but are rather the summits of them\u201d (In Tim. II 49.27\u201329). If one counts the whole heaven composed out of the best of the elements as one nature and adds to it the four sublunary elements, we may speak of five natures altogether.\nContrary to Aristotle, Proclus argues that the whole universe (to pan) is in a place (topos). He can do this because his conception of place differs in many respects from Aristotle\u2019s own. The latter defined place as \u201cthe unmoved limit of the surrounding body\u201d (Physics IV 4, 212a21\u201322). From this it follows as a necessary corollary that the universe as a whole cannot be in a place, because there is simply nothing outside it. Aristotle\u2019s definition, as we learn from Simplicius\u2019 and Philoponus\u2019 Corollary on Place, had been criticized by all later Neoplatonists (Syrianus, Proclus, Damascius, Simplicius, and Philoponus). It is notable that Proclus\u2019 own theory of place, as reported by Simplicius, differs considerably from other Neoplatonic theories in that he considered place an immaterial \u2018body\u2019, namely a special kind of immobile light. As emerges from Proclus\u2019 Commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic, his theory took inspiration from the column of light mentioned at Republic X, 616b.\nSince the heavenly bodies were considered divine, because they are eternal and living beings, the study of the heavens was of special importance to Neoplatonists. In the preface to his treatise On Astronomical Hypotheses (a summary and evaluation of astronomical views of his time), Proclus makes it clear that his approach is based on Plato\u2019s remarks on astronomy (especially in the Republic and in the Laws). He feels the need to go through the different theories, because one can observe a great disagreement among ancient astronomers on how to explain the different phenomena (Hyp. I \u00a7 33). Fundamental to Proclus\u2019 approach is the distinction between two kinds of astronomy (Hyp. I \u00a7 1\u20133). The first kind contents itself with observing the heavenly phenomena and formulating mathematical hypotheses to explain them and make calculations and prognostics possible. This is the astronomy as practiced by the most famous astronomers before Proclus\u2019 time (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy). The second, which is developed by Plato in the Timaeus, and is confirmed by the tradition of the \u201cChaldaeans and Egyptians,\u201d investigates into the intelligible causes of heavenly movements. An example for this approach can be found in his Commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic (In Remp. II 227.23\u2013235.3). There, Proclus explains that the seemingly irregular movements of the planets ought not to be explained by means of Ptolemy\u2019s complicated theory of excentric spheres and epicycles, but are rather due to the fact that the planets are moved by intelligent souls which express in the movements of their bodies \u201cthe invisible powers of the Forms\u201d (232.1\u20134). Yet Proclus appreciates Ptolemy\u2019s astronomy as long as it is seen only as a mathematical-mechanical construction making it possible to calculate and predict the positions of planets, and as long as it does not claim to have any real explanatory value. For the history of astronomy Proclus\u2019 Astronomical Hypotheses remains a most valuable document, since it represents one of the best introductions to Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest extant from antiquity and since it explains the most important ancient astronomical theories, in order finally (in chapter seven of the work) to evaluate them critically. Proclus\u2019 arguments also played an important role in the scientific discussion of the Ptolemaic hypotheses in the 16th and 17th century.\nProclus\u2019 distinctively non-empirical approach towards physics and astronomy also influences his philosophy of mathematics, which is set out in the two prologues to his commentary on the first book of Euclid\u2019s Elements. The first prologue deals with the mathematical sciences in general, while the second prologue focuses on geometry proper. Proclus argues in great detail that the objects of mathematical sciences cannot be derived from sensible particulars by means of abstraction. Because of the imperfect and deficient character of the sensible objects one cannot derive from them objects that are as perfect and as precise as mathematical objects are. Therefore, mathematical objects reside primarily in intellect and secondarily in souls (as logoi). As universal concepts (cf. 3.2) we can grasp mathematical objects by means of recollection (anamn\u00easis). Since geometrical objects are not universal, but particulars, and since by definition they possess extension, Proclus argues that their place is human imagination (phantasia). Imagination acts as a mirror and provides the mathematical objects which are projected into it by the soul with intelligible matter. By means of the latter geometrical objects gain extension and particularity. As with physics and astronomy, the ultimate aim of geometry is not the study of these extended, material objects. Rather, geometry serves an anagogical task (just as in Plato\u2019s Republic), leading the soul upwards to a study of the true and unextended causes of geometrical objects in the divine mind (In Eucl. 54.14\u201356.22).\nRelying on Plato, Theaetetus 176a-b late Platonists saw the assimilation to god (homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4i) as the goal (telos) of philosophy. Proclus was faithful to this ideal, as is attested by his biographer Marinus (Life of Proclus \u00a7 25). There was a fundamental discussion in late Neoplatonism on how this assimilation to the divine was possible for humans. Damascius (In Phaed. I \u00a7 172 Westerink) distinguishes two tendencies: Plotinus and Porphyry preferred philosophy, which makes us understand the divine principles of reality through rational explication, while others like Iamblichus and his followers, Syrianus, and Proclus, gave priority to hieratic practice or theurgy (theourgia, hieratik\u00ea [sc. techn\u00ea]). Their different evaluation of respectively theory and theurgy as means of salvation may be explained by their different views on the human soul and its possibilities of ascent to the divine realm. While Plotinus and Porphyry claimed that the superior part of the human soul always remains within the intelligible realm, in touch with the divine principles, and never completely descends into the body, Iamblichus, followed by Proclus, criticised such a view. The soul does indeed wholly descend into the body (Steel 1976, 34\u201351). Hence the importance of theurgic rites established by the gods themselves, to make it possible for the human soul to overcome the distance between the mortal and the divine, which cannot be done through increasing philosophical understanding. In Theol. Plat. I 25, Proclus expresses his great admiration for the power of theurgy, which surpasses all human knowledge.\nAs stated before (cf. 3.3), the human soul contains the principles (logoi) of all reality within itself. The soul carries, however, also sumbola or sunth\u00eamata which correspond to the divine principles of reality. The same symbols also establish the secret correspondences between sensible things (stones, plants, and animals) and celestial and divine realities. Thanks to these symbols, things on different levels (stones, plants, animals, souls) are linked in a \u2018chain\u2019 (seira) to the divine principle on which they depend, as the chain of the sun and the many solar beings, or the chain of the moon. Of great importance in the rituals was also the evocation of the secret divine names. In his Commentary on the Cratylus, Proclus compares divine names to statues of the gods used in theurgy (In Crat. \u00a7 46), pointing to the fact that also language is an important means in the ascent to the divine.\nIn the wake of an article of Anne Sheppard (1982), scholars usually distinguish between three kinds of theurgy in Proclus. The first kind, as described in the above quoted treatise On Hieratic Art, was mainly concerned with animating statues (in order to obtain oracles or to evoke divine apparitions) or, in general, with activities related to physical phenomena or human affairs (influencing the weather, healing illnesses etc.) (see Life of Proclus \u00a7 28\u201329). As emerges from our sources, it is this kind of theurgy that involved much ritualistic practice, including hymns and prayers. The second kind of theurgy makes the soul capable of ascending up to the level of the hypercosmic gods and the divine intellect. This second kind too operates by means of prayers and invocations and it seems especially characteristic of Proclus\u2019 Hymns. And finally, the third kind of theurgy establishes unity with the first principles, that is the One itself. This third kind corresponds to the level of the highest virtues (i.e., \u2018theurgic virtues\u2019) in the scale of virtues. It is not clear whether some form of ritual is involved here at all. For this last stage of the Platonic homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4i the following elements are of major importance: negative theology (culminating in the negation of the negation), mystic silence and the intriguing notion of faith (pistis), which thus enters with a non-Platonic meaning - though even for the latter notion Proclus will search for confirmation in the Platonic dialogues.\nThose who hasten to be conjoined with the Good, do no longer need knowledge and activity, but need to be established and a stable state and quietness. What then is it which unites us to the Good? What is it which causes in us a cessation of activity and motion? What is it which establishes all divine natures in the first and ineffable unity of goodness? [\u2026] It is, in short, the faith (pistis) of the Gods, which ineffably unites all the classes of Gods, of daemons, and of blessed souls to the Good. For we should investigate the Good not through knowledge (gn\u00f4stik\u00f4s) and in an imperfect manner, but giving ourselves up to the divine light, and closing the eyes, to become thus established in the unknown and occult unity of beings. For such a kind of faith is more venerable than cognitive activity, not in us only, but with the Gods themselves. (Proclus, Platonic Theology, I 25, trans. Th. Taylor, modified).\nThat Proclus, who set up his elaborate Platonic Theology in an attempt to rationally justify a pagan religious tradition whose existence was threatened by the upcoming Christian civilization, would have had such an influence in Christian medieval thought might seem surprising. His influence, however, is mainly indirect, as his ideas circulated under the names of other philosophers. There was, of course, a direct confrontation with the works of Proclus in the later Neoplatonic school (via Damascius and Ammonius, 5th-6th cc) and in Byzantium. In the 11th century, Michael Psellus studied Proclus intensively and even preserved fragments of his lost works. One of his disciples was the Georgian Ioanne Petritsi, who translated Proclus\u2019 Elements into Georgian and composed a commentary on it (Gigineishvili 2007). In the 12th century, bishop Nicolaus of Methone wrote a Christian reply to Proclus\u2019 Elements, thus showing indirectly that the work was still attracting interest. Moreover, Isaac Sebastocrator (11\u201312th century) produced a Christian adaption of the Tria opuscula. Around 1300 Proclus attracted the interest of the philosopher George Pachymeres, who prepared an edition of Proclus\u2019 Commentary on the Parmenides, which was only preserved in a very corrupt tradition, and even composed a commentary to the last part of the dialogue where Proclus\u2019 commentary was lacking. Cardinal Bessarion was an attentive reader of Proclus\u2019 works and possessed several manuscripts. We owe to the interest of scholars such as Psellus, Pachymeres, and Bessarion, the preservation of the work of the pagan Proclus, who had not such a good reputation in theological circles in Byzantium. And yet, the number of direct readers of Proclus before the Renaissance was very limited.\nDuring the Middle Ages Proclus\u2019 influence was mainly indirect, above all through the writings of the Christian author Dionysius the Areopagite and the Arabic Liber de causis. Dionysius was a Christian author writing around 500, who was deeply fascinated by Proclus. He fully exploited Proclus\u2019 works \u2013 which he must have read intensively \u2014 to develop his own original Christian Platonic theology. He presented himself as a disciple of Saint Paul, a pretence which was generally accepted until the late 19th century, thus giving his works, and indirectly Proclus\u2019 theology, an almost apostolic authority. As Dodds \u00b21969, xxviii, has nicely put it: \u201cProclus was [\u2026] conquering Europe in the guise of an early Christian.\u201d The well known Book of Causes is an Arabic adaption of the Elements of Theology, made in the 9th century. Translated in the 12th century, the Liber de causis circulated in the Middle Ages under the name of Aristotle, and was considered as a complement to the Metaphysics, offering a treatise on the divine causes. The text entered the corpus of Aristotelian works and was intensively studied and commented at the universities. Thomas Aquinas is the first to have discovered that this work derived in fact from Proclus\u2019 Elements of Theology, of which he had obtained a Latin translation made by his Dominican confrere William of Moerbeke in 1268 (see Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Liber de causis, introduction). Moerbeke also translated the Tria opuscula and the huge commentary on the Parmenides, but these works had almost no readers in the Middle Ages. Berthold of Moosburg wrote in the 14th century a comprehensive commentary on the Latin Elements of Theology . The real rediscovery of Proclus started in the Italian Renaissance, mainly thanks to Marsilio Ficino who followed Proclus\u2019 influence in his Platonic commentaries and even composed, in imitation of Proclus, a Christian Platonic Theology on the immortality of the soul. Before Ficino, Nicolaus Cusanus had already intensively studied Proclus in translations. Proclus continued to enjoy wide interest at the turn of the 18th century. Thomas Taylor (1758\u20131835) translated all of Proclus\u2019 works into English (reprinted by the Prometheus Trust [London]) and tried to reconstruct the lost seventh book of the Platonic Theology. Victor Cousin (1792\u20131867) aimed at a complete edition of his preserved work. At the beginning of the 20th century we have the great editions of commentaries in the Teubner collection. Renewed philosophical interest in Proclus in the last century started with the edition of the Elements of Theology by Eric Robertson Dodds, and carried on with the edition of the Platonic Theology by Henry Dominique Saffrey, Leendert Gerrit Westerink and, not least, in Germany with the works of Werner Beierwaltes.\nProclus\u2019 complete works (extant, lost, and spurious).\nDodds, E.R., 1933, 19632, The Elements of Theology, Oxford: Clarendon.\nBoese, H., 1987, Proclus: Elementatio theologica, translata a Guillelmo de Morbecca, (Series: KUL, Ancient and medieval philosophy, De Wulf-Mansion centre, Series, 1, vol. 5), Leuven: Leuven University Press.\nSaffrey, H.D., and L.G.

{"prompt": "Starting Tuesday, travellers from Europe, the Middle East and Africa will have to provide fingerprints and photos when they apply to visit, work or study in Canada, if they don\u2019t want to be turned away at the border.\nCurrently, foreign nationals are required to obtain pre-authorization to travel to Canada by air, and the biometric check on arrival is an extra step to confirm a person seeking admission is really the same pre-screened individual on the travel documents.\n\u201cBiometric screening has proven effective in protecting the safety and security of Canadians and the integrity of the immigration system. Systematic fingerprint verification allows border service officers to confirm a traveller\u2019s identity,\u201d said Immigration Department spokesperson Shannon Kerr.\n\u201cBiometric screening has also made it easier to identify known criminals at the earliest opportunity in order to prevent them from coming to Canada. It has made it more difficult for others to forge, steal or use another person\u2019s identity to gain access to Canada,\u201d Kerr added.\nSince 2013, personal biometric information has been required of tourists, students and foreign workers from 29 countries including", "baseline": "Afghanistan, Burma, Congo, Haiti, Sudan and Syria, as well as the Palestinian territories \u2014 all places where many refugees originate and the use of fraudulent travel documents is rampant.\nIn addition, permanent residency applicants from these countries and territory, as well as refugees and overseas refugee resettlement applicants were required to undergo biometric screening. The rule will extend to visitors from Asia, the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas on Dec. 31, when the biometric plan will be fully implemented.\n\u201cExpanding the collection and verification of biometrics to more applicants will strengthen immigration and border screening processes by confirming a person\u2019s identity,\u201d said Kerr.\nSince the requirement rolled out in 2013, Canada has collected biometric information from 1,066,806 students, foreign workers and tourists, resulting in matches to 760 Canadian criminal records, 1,951 previous asylum claimants and 157,105 previous immigration applicants, said Kerr.\nThe fingerprints, stored by the RCMP in the \u201cnational repository,\u201d are valid for 10 years and must be renewed when they expire.\nVisa-exempted nationals coming to Canada as tourists who hold a valid electronic travel authorization from Ottawa.\nChildren under 14 or applicants over 79.\nHeads of state and government.\nForeign nationals travelling to Canada must go to a Canadian visa application centre and pay a fee of $85 per person \u2014 or $170 for families \u2014 to cover the collection of fingerprints and a photograph. The centre is responsible for transmitting the records to and from the immigration offices.\nAt airports and land ports of entry, the Canada Border Services Agency will check a visitor\u2019s fingerprints against the record submitted by the visa centre in its database. Automatic fingerprint verification is available at eight major airports: Toronto Pearson, Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Pierre Elliott Trudeau in Montreal, and Halifax.\nAuthorities can deny entry to people with unmatched fingerprints, detain them and send them back.\nThe biometrics initiative is part of a joint border security information-sharing arrangement with the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.\nBoth the U.S. and Australia require fingerprints and a photograph from visiting foreign nationals, except Canadians. In the U.K., foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area have to apply for what\u2019s known as a biometric residence permit, while New Zealand currently requires the biometrics of asylum seekers, refugees applying for resettlement and deportees.\nBiometrics are not required of Americans applying for work or study permits and coming to Canada as tourists.\nCorrection - July 31, 2018: This article was updated from a previous version that said all permanent residency applicants and those seeking asylum within Canada, regardless of their country of origin, are already required to undergo biometric screening. In fact, prior to July 31, permanent residency applicants from 29 countries and one territory, as well as refugees and overseas refugee resettlement applicants were required to undergo biometric screening."}
{"prompt": "Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had just declared victory in the Nevada caucuses when most campaign reporters heard Jeffrey Berman\u2019s voice for the first and only time.\nBerman, Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s director of delegate selection, chimed in during a conference call with the media to make an unexpected case: Despite Clinton\u2019s popular vote victory in Nevada and an authoritative Associated Press count giving Clinton the edge in the Nevada delegate count, Obama had actually won the state by the only measure that mattered.\n\u201cObama had a majority in the district that had an odd number of delegates, so he won an extra seat,\u201d Berman told the puzzled press; the Associated Press delegate expert, on the call, promised to revise his count.\nObama\u2019s Nevada delegate victory was widely viewed at the time as a curiosity, an asterisk to Clinton\u2019s win. But in February, as Obama amassed delegates despite losing big states, the shape of the race became clear: The name of the game was delegates.\nIt was the game Berman and a friend, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe,", "baseline": "had been playing all along. And as Clinton\u2019s staff scrambled after Super Tuesday to remake her strategy to meet that reality, it began to become clear that Berman had helped build Obama a lead too big to surmount.\n\u201cHe is the unsung hero of the Obama effort,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic consultant who supports Clinton.\nThe bearded, no-profile 50-year-old lawyer\u2019s central role in Obama\u2019s likely nomination is emblematic of the depth of Obama\u2019s preparation for the 2008 campaign.\nClinton\u2019s delegate chief is the much-heralded, oft-profiled, tough-talking past master of the party\u2019s rules, Harold Ickes.

{"prompt": "KEI KECIL, Indonesia: It is believed by many on the Kei Islands that some of their earliest ancestors came from Bali, braving the long expanses of sea to the west.\nThose original descendants, countless generations ago, jumping from one island to the next, found a home in Kei. They brought religion and culture to a truly remote part of the world, a paradise that largely still exists in raw form.\nWhere Bali has exploded into one of the world\u2019s best known holiday escapes, Kei\u2019s location - closer to Darwin in Australia than Jakarta - has left it in a long shadow. From a state of seclusion adrift in the Banda Sea, the islands\u2019 magic has been left untapped.\nThere are no beachside cocktail bars or luxury resorts in sight. Instead, the gentle waves lap onto some of the world\u2019s finest untouched sand, so ethereal and white that the locals compare it to flour.\nBali receives as many foreign tourists per day as Kei has had in total over the past seven years. There is a staggering gulf", "baseline": "in fortunes when it comes to modern development.\nBut under the administration of Indonesian President Joko Widodo, the development of eastern Indonesia has come into focus. He wants to attract investors to spur economic growth in eastern Indonesia, where significant challenges exist compared to the more populous west. For instance, poor connectivity has seen commodity prices soar for local populations.\nHowever, the resulting massive infrastructure projects rolled out in recent years, including roads and airports, as well as the investment in vast internet networks, has the remote region well placed to take advantage of a growing curiosity of domestic and foreign travellers to explore the country\u2019s outer reaches.\nLong after the intoxicating days of pirates and spice in this part of the world, once at the centre of a global tussle for cloves, nutmeg and mace, a new bounty is being uncovered.\nKei is starting to enjoy the riches of the government\u2019s attention. The airport is built for a future growth in capacity, the roads are surprising in their size and quality and 4G coverage even reaches budding Instagrammers on outer atolls surrounded by lively coral reefs.\nGetting to Kei Kecil remains a challenge to all but the equally intrepid and well-heeled. Domestic flights from Jakarta, connecting in Makassar and Ambon, still cost hundreds of dollars each way. Schedules are still limited but more frequent flights - and some building competition between Garuda Airlines and Lion Air - suggest fares could eventually drop.\nLocal tourism authorities now want to ignite the industry and create a \u201cmini Bali\u201d. It is a marketing tag thrown around regularly in Indonesia but Petrus Renwarin, the secretary of tourism in South East Maluku, says Kei\u2019s ambitions have substance.\nThey are building cooperation with Bali authorities, using ancestry links as a contemporary connector between the two destinations.\n\u201cThere is a more permanent strategy looking at how they can help us. If the tourists go there we can divert them to come here as well,\u201d Petrus said.\nTourism is a new concept for Kei residents, but many are showing a keen desire to be involved.\nOn Wab Beach, an exquisite stretch of waterfront, a local man was busy hammering and sawing under the shade of a grove of coconut trees. He was constructing a warung, a simple restaurant, as part of a community effort to attract visitors to the area. Nearby, other stalls were being put together, hammocks stretched between trunks and a social media-ready swing framed by the shimmering waters was ready to be snapped.\nA couple of years ago, 65-year-old Alfred Inuhan said, no-one from Wab would have ever seen a foreigner padding across the sand or wading in the shallows. Today, they are still rare, but he is hoping that will soon change.\n\u201cWe want a lot of of foreign tourists to come,\u201d he said. His simple hospitality is just a start, he says, and he welcomes larger scale tourism investment, on his land or in the area, even if the sight of bikini-clad visitors would come as quite a shock for some.\n\u201cWe really understand that tourists come but they will not change our culture. I believe that Bali in the beginning was also like that but sooner or later it has changed, since I already visited Kuta and have seen that myself.\n\u201cKei culture is about respecting one another. Whoever they are, we respect them,\u201d he said.\nOne of the local tourism industry pioneers based near Kei\u2019s best known beach, Pasir Panjang, a pristine three-kilometre stretch of powdery sand, has doubts about plans to attract more people.\nGeeryt Martin Tarantyin started one of Kei\u2019s first guesthouses after visiting the island, the traditional home of his father, back in 1989. He continues to run the rustic beach lodgings with his wife Lucy, attracting backpackers, families of explorers and curious Jakartans.\n\u201cWhen people come here they think I live in a paradise,\u201d he said, explaining that in the past the only way to reach Kei was by taking ferries that slowly traverse the seas, connecting the archipelago as far as Batam, near Singapore.\nThat isolation brought challenges, but also protection. Now, he fears local and investors alike may have good intentions but cultural misunderstandings are inevitable.\nPetrus confirmed that five-star developments would be developed \u201cin the near future\u201d but Tarantyin says local beliefs similar to voodoo could stand in the way.\nLand ownership is problematic in Kei because of the possible effects of \u2018sasi\u2019, meaning prohibition. It is a powerful superstition invoked throughout Maluku, a kind of unseen magic that locals cast onto property or land to ensure others cannot possess or use it without proper permission.\nIn 2003, the bridge between the island\u2019s two main towns, Tual and Langgur, had sasi placed upon it due to a land dispute. No-one dared to cross for months, until officials remedied the situation and held a ceremony to remove it.\nIn the case of a prospective hotel on Kei, entire communities would need to have their say on the sale or lease of land. Land is communal, not owned by individuals and negotiations can be lengthy and difficult.\n\u201cIf you want to buy ground here, the whole community needs to know and approve. If you miss one family, maybe they can put sasi,\u201d Tarantyin said.\nPetrus says having united decisions about the future of Kei will bring about togetherness. From land use to conservation and protection of the environment, he wants locals to have a stake. It is the Kei way.\n\u201cLocal people are very proud when the tourists come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the custom of accepting people no matter what.\nThe local government is yet to introduce concrete economic plans to assist villagers navigate a possible looming tide of outsiders, rather it is providing \u201cthe spirit\u201d to help push them forward.\nPromotion is mostly being left up to informal groups, like a collection of youth under the umbrella Kei Paradise. They are harnessing Instagram to expose Kei to the world.\n\u201cWe are promoting an unknown destination,\u201d said one of its founders, Rudolof Stanislaus Rettob.\n\u201cWe often sell Kei as a complete destination. But since it is far away, there are lot of obstacles. Many tourists say that they prefer to go to Singapore rather than Kei, because of the cost, not just the distance.\nIn the meantime, Rudolof and his partners continue to explore their own home, discovering more - the hidden beaches, cascading waterfalls, mysterious caves and limestone formations - all with the hope that others too, will be enraptured by what Kei holds.\nThe lure of the horizon, the idyllic, the unknown.

{"prompt": "Renting an apartment with bad credit may not be easy. Many large apartment complexes owned by corporations now require credit checks and will refuse applicants who do not meet their standards. Even if you have the income to pay for the apartment, you may still be refused if your credit score is too low.\nIs Renting an Apartment with Bad Credit Possible?\nOne way to solve this problem is to bypass the credit issue entirely. Many privately-owned homes and apartment buildings do not look at credit, preferring to find tenants with good references from previous landlords. You can find advertisements for privately-owned rentals in the classified section of your newspaper, on the internet at sites like Craig's List and Rental.com, as well as through local real estate agents.\nMany local homeowners and condo owners rent their houses because they are having trouble selling them in the current real estate market, so you may be able to find a very nice property at a reasonable rate, provided you are a good tenant and are willing to keep the place clean and in order.\nHowever, more and more private owners are looking at credit checks as one way", "baseline": "to separate the \"good\" tenants from the \"bad\" tenants. If you are forced to deal with the credit issue, you can salvage some of the damage by handling your bad credit report in a proactive way.\nStep #1: Clean up your credit.\nFirst, get a copy of your credit report and check it carefully. You can get a credit report from your bank or by contacting the \"Big 3\u2033 credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. You are entitled to one free copy from each per year; you can also request additional copies at a cost.\nReview your credit report carefully and get someone such as a banker or financial manager to go over it with you if you do not understand it. You can also find internet sites which translate the terminology and abbreviations on your report.\nNext, dispute any inaccurate information. Sometimes companies report a late payment incorrectly, or you may have been charged for something you did not purchase. If you dispute a transaction, it is up to the lender or seller to prove that you were truly late with your payment or that you did not pay a bill. If the seller or lender cannot prove this, the credit bureau will remove the bad credit from your report.\nStep #2: Talk to your potential landlord.\nOnce your credit report is clean, you are better able to determine if it will be a report that will trigger a \"no\" with prospective landlords. If you had a few late payments to a hospital five years ago, you are far less likely to be turned down by a landlord than if you had three evictions last year from apartment complexes for non-payment of rent.\nUse common sense when analyzing your credit report; if you are unsure how something will impact your rental prospects, ask the landlord what type of information they gather when looking at a credit report. Be honest if you have had late payments in the past, and ask the agent or representative of the rental company if this will disqualify you from renting. Surprisingly, in many cases, it won't.\nStep #3: If necessary, find a cosigner.\nYou can also use the cosigner option. If you have a parent, spouse or friend with good credit who is willing to sign for you, renting an apartment with bad credit is often no problem. Of course, this is because the landlord knows that your cosigner will be on the hook for any rent you do not pay.\nThis is a terrible option to take if you are unable to pay the rent in a timely manner, because you will not only be hurting your own credit, but that of someone else. If you do know someone willing to cosign, you must commit to making your payments every month, on time.\nStep #4: Be prepared to pay up front.\nFinally, you may be approved for an apartment rental in spite of bad credit, but have to pay more up front or per month. Some larger corporations have instituted measures whereby those with poor credit can still rent, but have to pay much larger security deposits. Generally, the security deposit is reflective of how much rent you would pay during the time it takes to evict you for non-payment of rent.\nFor example, suppose you pay $600 a month for your apartment and it takes 90 days to evict a tenant in your state. Expect to pay around $1,800 in additional security money up front, as the landlord will want that money in escrow in case you default on your rental payments.\nThis post originally appeared on Go Banking Rates."}
{"prompt": "Position dovetails with French stand; Olmert tells Mitchell IDF op gave PA chance to reassert in Gaza.\nIn a sign that the international community's position on Hamas is weakening, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana would not say unequivocally Wednesday during an interview with The Jerusalem Post that the EU should stick with the three preconditions it set for talking with the Islamist group. Solana's comments came as US special Mideast envoy George Mitchell arrived in Israel on what Israeli officials described as a \"stock-taking\" mission. One of the major issues on the agenda was consolidating the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Ever since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, the international community has largely isolated it, saying it must recognize Israel, forswear violence, and accept previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements. Since Operation Cast Lead, however, there are an increasing number of voices in Europe saying this policy is anachronistic, and that a way must be found to deal directly with Hamas. Asked his opinion, Solana said, \"We want to move in a", "baseline": "political dynamic, that political dynamic is impossible to have outside two basic parameters.\" Solana said those two parameters were a two-state solution and the Arab League peace initiative. Solana's comments dovetailed with efforts by some in Europe, led by France, to drop recognition of Israel as a condition for talking with Hamas, saying it would be enough if Hamas accepted the Arab peace initiative, which calls for a two-state solution, and which would then be tantamount to tacit recognition of Israel. Foreign Ministry officials said this position weakened the Israeli and US argument that there are moderate Palestinians with whom it is possible to work, and extremists who must not be given legitimacy. \"It is clear that some in Europe are looking for a way to deal with Hamas,\" one official said. \"They are willing to give up on the need to recognize Israel. But that is a cornerstone of our policy.\" He said Israel would diplomatically fight any changes to the three conditions, and that letting Hamas in \"through the back\" door would only weaken the Palestinian Authority and President Mahmoud Abbas. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in his meeting on Wednesday with Mitchell, said Hamas had emerged weakened from Operation Cast Lead, and there was now an opportunity for the PA to reestablish itself in some form inside the Strip. Olmert also talked about the Gaza border crossings with Mitchell, saying that while they would be open for humanitarian assistance, they would not return to \"full, routine functioning until the issue of Gilad Schalit is solved.\" According to Olmert's office, the two men also spoke about the diplomatic process, with Olmert repeating his commitments to a two-state solution, the Annapolis process, and the road map peace plan. He also reiterated to Mitchell the importance of former US president's George W. Bush's letter to Ariel Sharon stating that the US recognized that facts on the ground had changed since 1967 and would have to be taken into consideration when drawing up future borders, and that the US would not support a right of Palestinians refugees to return to pre-1967 Israel. Mitchell also met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who, according to a statement issued by her office, said that while Israel believed in the two-state vision, Palestinian refugees would not be allowed into Israel. Other top Israeli officials, including the Defense Ministry's Diplomatic-Security Bureau chief Amos Gilad, Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilna'i and Israeli Ambassador to the US Sallai Meridor later joined the meeting between Barak and Mitchell. Mitchell also met President Shimon Peres. The US envoy, after meeting Olmert, issued a brief statement saying that \"the prime minister and I discussed the critical importance to consolidate the cease-fire, including the cessation of hostilities and an end to smuggling, and the reopening of crossings based on the 2005 agreement. President Obama has said the US is committed to Israel's security and to its right to defend itself against legitimate threats.\" Mitchell, who did not take any questions from the press, said Obama had made clear that the US \"sustain an active commitment toward reaching the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security.\" Before coming to Israel, Mitchell met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, and following their talks told reporters that the Gaza cease-fire was \"critical.\" \"The United States is committed to vigorously pursuing lasting peace and stability in the region,\" he said. On Thursday, Mitchell is scheduled to meet Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, Mossad director Meir Dagan and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) head Yuval Diskin. He will then go to Ramallah for a meeting with Abbas and PA Prime Minister Salaam Fayad. On Friday he is scheduled to meet Likud head Binyamin Netanyahu, before going to Amman. He is also scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Paris and London before returning to Washington early next week. Tovah Lazaroff contributed to this report."}

{"prompt": "I am compelled to get the word out regarding a Senate bill that could adversely affect private preschools in California. The bill is labeled SB 837 or Kindergarten Readiness Act of 2014. This bill is written with good intentions, but the implementation is a problem. The bill written by state Sen. Darrell Steinberg is asking for approval to provide free preschool to all 4-year-olds \u2014 a noble idea. Because of how the author and co-authors have chosen to fund the bill, it places these 4-year-olds in our public school system. I would imagine any person in the field of early childhood development; teacher, psychologist and doctor would oppose this bill.\nThe bill states that through longitudinal studies it has been found that those children who attended quality preschool programs had higher graduation rates, college enrollment rates and earning rates. This is what preschool educators have provided for years. Four-year-olds still need help developing social skills and gaining confidence. They need space inside and out allowing them to explore their environment. This will not happen at an elementary school. Elementary schools predominantly", "baseline": "have blacktop as the surface outside. Inside the classroom, the environment will not be warm and inviting as in a quality preschool and won\u2019t have the supplies needed to create and invent.\nWhat about working parents that need an after-school program? After a certain time of day, the young children will more than likely be mixed in with the older children (as it is now). Again, not appropriate. The funding cannot be used to upgrade facilities for 4-year-olds; meaning they will make do with what they have in place, which is suited for 5 years and up. Let\u2019s also talk about whether or not your local school has space to house a whole new age of children. Will class sizes grow in the other grades to make space for the younger children?\nIf this bill passes how it is written, with parents unable to access the funding and choose a quality preschool, we feel that a great number of private preschools will have to shut their doors. Most preschools have 50% of children age 4, which also helps the schools differ the costs of the younger children who require smaller class sizes. As we have seen through the already implemented TK classes in the public schools, parents will leave a preschool they have to pay for, if another one is free. If we can\u2019t keep our doors open because of losing half our clientele then who will service the families with younger children? This bill could impact preschools, teachers, vendors and families.\nLet\u2019s put aside all the financial ramifications. My passion is and has been helping shape the minds and spirits of young children. I have been in the field for 23 years, first as a teacher and now as a director of Parents and Children\u2019s Nursery School in La Ca\u00f1ada. None of us in our field do our jobs for the paycheck, because there isn\u2019t much of one. We do it because we are passionate about helping young children understand who they are and how far they can go.\nWe need to keep enriching our children with experiences, music, art and expression. A quality program embraces the whole child. Children leave us with the love of school and the curiosity needed to learn. We need our artists, musicians, scientists and writers as well as our leaders in business. Our public school system has already taken away so much from our children. Do we want them to take it away even sooner?\nMARJI GOLDEN is a resident of Glendale. She can be reached at ParentsandChildren@sbcglobal.net."}

{"prompt": "A report this weekend by Axios cited documents from within the National Security Council describing the possibility \u2014 nay, inevitability \u2014 of a 5G network built and operated by the U.S. government. Officials have since poured cold water on this idea, and really, it was never feasible.\nIn brief, the report cited by Axios suggested that the only way to truly secure the next generation of wireless networks, on which critical infrastructure like self-driving cars will rely, against snooping by China and others, would be for the government to build that network itself.\nThere are several things wrong with this idea. You probably thought of a couple before you even got to this sentence.\nThat would be awkward, since those companies, along with others around the world, are well into the process of testing and deploying 5G networks. The idea of a government network operating separately but in concert with the commercial networks doesn\u2019t hold water (we\u2019ve considered it before).\nEven if it was attempted, there\u2019s just no way that the U.S. government, even at its best and most efficient, and if it started bipartisan work on this tom", "baseline": "orrow, could be in any way competitive in the timing and scale of such a deployment. It takes billions of dollars and years of work to lay the foundation for something like this, and others have a huge head start. And let us not forget that we are experiencing one of an endless series of budget crises, which would not be alleviated by the proposal of this kind of massive undertaking.\nI oppose any proposal for the federal government to build and operate a nationwide 5G network. The main lesson to draw from the wireless sector\u2019s development over the past three decades\u2014including American leadership in 4G\u2014is that the market, not government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment. What government can and should do is to push spectrum into the commercial marketplace and set rules that encourage the private sector to develop and deploy next-generation infrastructure. Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\nThe United States\u2019 leadership in the deployment of 5G is critical and must be done right. Localities have a central role to play; the technical expertise possessed by industry should be utilized; and cybersecurity must be a core consideration. A network built by the federal government, I fear, does not leverage the best approach needed for our nation to win the 5G race.\nWhile I\u2019m glad that the Trump Administration recognizes that maintaining American leadership in the information age requires a significant investment commitment, I\u2019m concerned that constructing a nationalized 5G network would be both expensive and duplicative, particularly at a time when the Administration is proposing to slash critical federal investments in R&D and broadband support for unserved areas.\nThe Trump administration itself told Recode that the document Axios saw was dated, and that it wasn\u2019t a seriously considered proposition. The National Security Council doesn\u2019t oversee broadband deployment, and there\u2019s no way this would get past the FCC, which as you can see above would likely be united in opposition to such a strategy.\nAnd although the NSC clearly has national security in mind when it suggests this path, I frankly would not trust the government to build a secure network of any kind, let alone one this big. There would also be considerable irony in a government attempting to secure its internet infrastructure while simultaneously attempting to undermine effective encryption.\nThe U.S. government may very well use part of the 5G network being built for its own purposes, and it of course subsidizes the rollout of the tech so it can use it itself \u2014 first responder networks, military stuff, that kind of thing. But the idea that it would, or could, build a competitive 5G network in the manner suggested has no basis in reality."}

It is one of hundreds of letters, emails, postcards and voice messages I received \u2014 to say nothing of menacing discussions of me on white supremacist websites \u2014 after I wrote and published the essay \u201cDear White America\u201d in December 2015 here at The Stone. What I had offered as a letter of love had unleashed the very opposite \u2014 a wave of white hatred and dehumanization.\nAfter receiving the letter that spoke of a cold slab and shutting my mouth permanently, I decided to share it with my students in my graduate philosophy seminar. I needed a witness \u2014 perhaps I needed my students to help carry some of what I was feeling. So, I read it aloud.\nI had not anticipated my emotional response. As I read the letter, I began to feel a different kind of threat. The kind of threat that has implications for those whom I love. You see, a threat to my life will inevitably impact the lives of my loved ones. And that is a threat that impacts me, my body, my spirit, with a different kind of existential and emotional gravitas.\nWhen I finished reading the letter, I looked at my students as I thought about the reverberations of such a threat. My eyes watered, my body became stilted, I felt a rush of unspeakable anger run through my blood. I said to my students: \u201cThis involves my loved ones. I can\u2019t take this hatred anymore! I need a few minutes outside of class.\u201d The room fell silent.\nWell, that didn\u2019t happen. I came back into the room, where everyone was still silent. My students\u2019 faces, for the most part, were turned down. I know what they had felt, black students, students of color and white alike. They bore witness to my vulnerability, my suffering, the sting of unmitigated hatred. And they saw the impact in an otherwise safe academic space.\nA few moments passed. I apologized to them and resumed teaching. But the space between us in the classroom was not the same; we had witnessed something together. That space will never be the same.\nI wanted to model for my students what it is like to be a contemporary philosopher who remains steadfast in the face of hatred. I wanted them to internalize something of what it means to practice philosophy, to love wisdom, in the face of danger, threats of violence and intolerance. Yet, there was a part of me that failed that day.\nMy composure had collapsed. I seemed to have lost my bearing, my confidence was shaken. I was pushed to rethink what I assumed was a mission of love, the kind of love that refuses to hide and requires profound forms of vulnerability. I had wanted to help heal our broken world, to exalt love in an otherwise ethically catastrophic America. Now I could hear the voices of some of my students of color, \u201cDr. Yancy, why do you continue to write about whiteness and to address white people?\u201d There is affection and alarm in that question, concern for my safety. And it is a reasonable question.\nGiven such nasty, unconscionable, violent and perhaps liable discourse, why do I continue to speak to white America about its racism? After all, I am not a masochist, nor do I want to be a martyr.\nIt is true that being on the receiving end of such hate caused me to grow weary, fatigued and profoundly pained. Mixed with all of that was the outrage I felt when \u201cwhite innocence\u201d was uncovered as white privilege and white complicity with systems of white racism. I had become, as the civil rights heroine Fannie Lou Hamer once said, \u201csick and tired of being sick and tired.\u201d And in so many ways, and for good reason, I still am.\nSo, here I am facing a dilemma. Do I give up on white people, on white America, or do I continue to fight for a better white America, despite the fact that my efforts continue to lead to forms of unspeakable white racist backlash?\nI am convinced that America suffers from a pervasively malignant and malicious systemic illness \u2014 white racism. There is also an appalling lack of courage, weakness of will, spinelessness and indifference in our country that helps to sustain it. That indifference is itself a cruel reality, a reality that often makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs until I fall flat on my face from exhaustion. That indifference makes me sick to my stomach.\nWhen it comes to white racist hatred, America never seems to have short supply. Perhaps you believe that I exaggerate. But I know better. You see, many whites in America have no need of me. They refuse what James Baldwin called a disagreeable mirror, one that shows them what they would rather not see.\nWhite people have told me where to go: \u201cYancy, flights leave for Africa every day. We can all admit bringing you to this country was a mistake, so let us get rid of you and correct the mistake. You are not happy, we are not happy with your behavior, so do it.\u201d Or \u201cThere are two ways you can return to Africa: On a passenger ship, or in a coffin freighter. Choose quickly.\u201d Notice the urgency of that warning, the implied threat to my life.\nBeheaded ISIS style? A meat hook? Kill myself? Reader, the sickness of these threats should trouble your very soul.\nJames Baldwin writes, \u201cPeople who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.\u201d White America has long lost its innocence. Given its horrendous treatment of the indigenous peoples of this land, there was never any innocence. There were monsters, though. Land takers. Brutal dispossession. And then body snatchers and the selling and buying of black flesh. To be haunted while asleep has its advantages, because one will awake. But to be haunted while awake by a teratology of whiteness is far more frightening.\nIn response to these positive responses, however, some will still insist, \u201cTheir white history speaks louder than their words.\u201d But history, I say, is not fixed. And as human beings we are protean."}

I did it honestly and I have no doubt,\" Battle told The Associated Press at the office of her attorney, Sheldon Starke.\nBattle&apos;s suggestion on television that she had bought and lost the winning ticket \"made me laugh,\" Jemison said.\n\"Let authorities handle her,\" she said. \"It&apos;s very unfortunate that someone would think of something like this.\"\nThe lottery commission had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, said spokeswoman Mardele Cohen. Jemison, who said she had waited to come forward because she wanted to speak with a lawyer and accountant, could not be reached for comment after the suit was filed.\nJemison, who handles telephone and doctor paging duties at a suburban hospital, said she is looking forward to buying a new home, taking a vacation and sharing her prize with her family. She and her husband, Sam, have a 12-year-old daughter.\nShe took her winnings in an immediate lump sum of $94 million, before taxes. After taxes, it will be worth an estimated $67.2 million.\nSouth Euclid, meanwhile, is expecting its own windfall to the tune of about $1.4 million in taxes from the prize. The Cleveland suburb had been expecting a $1 million deficit for 2004, and Mayor Georgine Welo laid off 11 employees last week.\nWelo said Tuesday the unexpected income tax will make life easier in South Euclid, and that she likely would soon rehire two of the laid-off workers.\nEarlier Tuesday, Starke, unaware that the lottery was validating Jemison&apos;s claim, said he intended to make a case that the winning ticket was Battle&apos;s lost property.\n\"If there is one type of property that is not presumed to be abandoned, it&apos;s money,\" he said. \"Anyone who finds it is not the owner.\"\nThe Ohio Lottery says the ticket is a bearer note, which means whoever turns in a valid ticket is legally entitled to the winnings.\nAfter learning that Jemison turned in the winning ticket, South Euclid police Lt. Kevin Nietert said he had not been able to reach Battle and her attorney by phone. \"From a police department point of view, it obviously draws into question the integrity of Elecia Battle&apos;s report.\"\nThe winning ticket was sold at Quick Shop Food Mart in South Euclid, about 15 miles east of Cleveland.\nBattle filed a police report saying she dropped her purse as she left the store after buying the ticket. She said she realized after the drawing last Tuesday that the ticket was missing and told police that the numbers she picked represented family birthdays and ages."}
{"prompt": "Before SAP Labs designed its new digs in Palo Alto, company executives asked employees how to make it a welcoming place to work. After all, that\u2019s where they spend most of their day.\nThe answer? Windows. Lots of windows letting in lots of light.\nThe German-based business software company complied \u2013 even going so far as to move executives away from windows to give more workers access to daylight.\nAs the country embraces \u201cgreen\u201d building design \u2013 be it in the workplace or at home \u2013 daylight has become a premium. Not only does it save energy \u2013 more sunlight means less bulb light \u2013 but research shows that workers with access to natural light are more productive.\n\u201cYour mind is pretty powerful. If you feel more connected naturally, you perform better,\u201d said Alan Turner, principal of the Mountain View architectural firm Hawley, Peterson and Snyder, which designed the Hewlett Foundation\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, one of California\u2019s first buildings to earn a gold rating from the U.S. Green Building Council.\nPerhaps, but recent studies supporting the productivity claim are helping architects convince developers that such", "baseline": "green features are good for business \u2013 everybody\u2019s business. Not only can landlords charge more for the space, but companies can achieve better results from their employees.\nLisa Heschong, founder of Heschong Mahone Group in Sacramento, has spent years studying the connection between people and sunlight. In 2003, Heschong studied workers in a Sacramento Municipal Utility District call center to discover whether natural light plus a view made any difference.\nBased on a 1999 analysis she performed with shoppers and schoolchildren, she already knew that natural light caused shoppers to buy more and students to perform better in school. But in the study requested by the California Energy Commission, she wanted to analyze worker productivity and whether it mattered if people had a view.\n\u201cWe found really, really big effects,\u201d said Heschong, who studied two call centers operating 12 hours a day with 100 employees. In each study, employees with views outside their windows answered and processed calls 7 percent faster than employees doing the same work without a view.\nNo one is exactly sure why people perform better with a view, but Heschong has a theory. It has to do with circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycle in the physiological processes of living beings.\nWhile the data was compelling, when it was released four years ago there was little if any construction under way in the U.S. commercial real estate market, and Silicon Valley was experiencing one of its worst downturns in history. Now that the construction pipeline is bulging with commercial projects, the research is beginning to resonate with companies planning new buildings, as well as the developers in charge of building them.\nIn fact, after years of watching developers\u2019 eyes glaze over when he mentioned environmentally friendly design, David Hobstetter, principal at KMD Architects in San Francisco, has seen a change.\nOne developer who\u2019s already on board is Jay Paul Co. of San Francisco, currently building Silicon Valley\u2019s largest development in five years, the 1.8-million-square-foot Moffett Towers. Matt Lituchy, chief investment officer for Jay Paul, said bona fide research linking light with worker productivity helps make the case for designing buildings with more natural lighting.\nThe seven-building, eight-story Moffett Towers offer what Lituchy called a \u201ccurtain wall\u201d of floor-to-ceiling windows, with floors that measure 38,000 square feet, allowing more light to reach the buildings\u2019 interior. In comparison, much of the valley\u2019s older building stock has floors that are two and three times as large, and not much if any light reaches inside. None of the Moffett Towers buildings has leased yet, but Lituchy said the interest is high.\nTo critics who say such construction costs too much, architects counter that green design is no longer more expensive than standard design because more suppliers have entered the marketplace, bringing down prices.\nCompanies have also discovered that offices designed to make workers more comfortable pay for themselves. Standard industry norms say that during a building\u2019s 30-year life cycle, a company will spend 90 percent of the costs on salaries for its workers; 3 percent on energy for lighting, heating and cooling; 4 percent on operating the building; and 3 percent on constructing the building.\n\u201cIf we can achieve a minor improvement in productivity \u2013 and good daylighting has demonstrated that you can get 7, 8 or 10 percent improvements in performance \u2013 you pay for the bricks and mortar,\u201d said Hobstetter, whose firm is designing the San Francisco headquarters for the Public Utilities Commission, touted to be the greenest building in the country.\nRoney said that bolstered with the research, he has little trouble convincing the bosses to give up the corner office with a view so more people can enjoy it. Especially in Silicon Valley, where companies lure workers with such features as chef-prepared meals, massages and dry cleaning service, it stands to reason that offices with views would not be a tough sell.\n\u201cAll companies are realizing that their most important asset is their people,\u201d Roney said."}
{"prompt": "Wait, Did Trump\u2019s EPA Just Do Its Job for a Change?\nLook at that beaut. Volvo\u2019s all-electric truck, the Volvo FL Electric.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it plans to better regulate the pollutants spewing out of heavy-duty trucks. Yes, this is the same EPA that wants to keep coal power plants alive, plans to scrap regulations on mercury emissions, and does not care about fuel efficiency.\nCould Trump\u2019s EPA actually be doing something helpful for our planet and health for a change? Maybe! But let\u2019s not get too ahead of ourselves here.\nThe proposed \u201cCleaner Truck Initiative\u201d seeks to decrease nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from heavy-duty trucks, which can worsen or help spur asthma and other respiratory issues when inhaled regularly. These gases can also help contribute to the formation of smog. Nitrous oxide, a form of nitrogen oxide, also warms the planet, making up 6 percent of U.S.", "baseline": "greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe proposal to tighten NOx emissions standards, which have not been updated since 2001, began under former President Barack Obama. And while it\u2019s a rare sign of progress for Trump\u2019s EPA to push forward with an Obama-era regulation, this one still doesn\u2019t go far enough, said Mustafa Ali, former environmental justice administrator at the EPA.\nThe U.S. emitted 14.1 million tons of NOx in 2011. In 2014, roughly half of those emissions were from vehicles. Most of those come from vehicles running on diesel like heavy duty trucks, according to a 2017 EPA document. If we were really serious about decreasing this (and all other) truck pollution, it\u2019d mean going electric.\nObviously, this is easier said than done: Implementing a nationwide ban on fossil fuel trucks would require a complete infrastructure makeover that\u2019d switch out gas stations for charging stations to support these vehicles. And of course, charging stations would need to run on renewable energy for the electric vehicles to be better for the environment. If the EPA even took the miraculous step of mandating zero truck emissions, industry officials and likely even state governments would be pissed and challenge the proposal in court.\nNothing about it would be easy.\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be impossible, and radical change is becoming increasingly necessary as the threat of catastrophic climate change looms. And other countries are stepping up. Spain, for example, proposed Tuesday to remove all gas-powered cars from its roads by 2040. Other European countries and cities are also moving forward with fossil fuel car bans. If the U.S. is going to update these standards, why not go all the way?\nHe\u2019s right: In 2017, University of Washington researchers published findings on nitrogen dioxide emissions nationwide, which largely come from transportation, and found that people of color experienced higher exposure to this pollutant between 2000 to 2010. That\u2019s why advocacy organizations like the Moving Forward Network have been urging the EPA to implement zero-emissions technologies in heavy-duty trucks since at least 2016.\nThe communities that live day to day exposed to pollution from truck traffic are sure to welcome any relief. The EPA could always, however, go a step further to ensure no communities need to bear the burden of unhealthy air."}

{"prompt": "Hair loss is no longer an inevitable march to baldness. Medical advances in recent decades mean male hair loss can be treated, and it need not break the bank.\nThe cause of male pattern baldness is well established as an act of nature not nurture. Identical twins go bald at the same age, rate and pattern, irrespective of diet, lifestyle or stress levels.\nThere's no need to go bald any more.\nBaldness is a complex polygenic trait: up to five genes are involved, and it is the interplay between these genes, not unlike the interaction between the cards in a poker hand, that determine the specifics of male pattern hair loss.\nSo, what are the treatment options?\nFinasteride is a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved drug that dermatologists and general practitioners have been prescribing to treat hair loss for about 15 years.\nIt works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate, by blocking an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.\nYou'll need a prescription for", "baseline": "finasteride, and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of the drug before you decide to proceed.\nThe benefits are clear: men who start taking daily finasteride at the first signs of hair loss will not go bald. Plus there are no interactions with other drugs.\nBut there is a small risk of sexual side effects such as such as erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory problems and reduced libido, which require careful management by an experienced doctor.\nAn added bonus is that finasteride reduces a man's future chance of developing of prostate cancer, though it does not increase longevity, as the reduction in risk is exclusively for low-risk prostate cancer, which is not the type men generally die from.\nThe cost for a year's supply of tablets starts at as low as about $200 (plus the extra you will need to put aside for haircuts!).\nDeveloped in the 1950s as a tablet to treat high blood pressure, minoxidil was an abject failure because of unwanted hair growth. Reinvented as a lotion applied directly to the scalp, it was launched in the United States in 1988 and soon became popular around the world.\nMinoxidil is also TGA-approved and available over the counter in pharmacies for between $15 and $60 a month, depending on the brand.\nNo prescription or trip to the doctor is required, but talk to your pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, especially high-blood-pressure medication.\nHair removal laser has led to a renaissance in the use of minoxidil tablets, as doctors can now effectively manage the unwanted hair that was previously a deal breaker. Low doses of minoxidil, as low as one-40th of a tablet, can still grow hair with minimal effect on blood pressure and no need to put anything in your hair.\nWhile finasteride works best at arresting progression of genetically programmed hair loss, some men will achieve partial regrowth. The sooner you begin treatment, the more hair there is to protect.\nMinoxidil is better at stimulating new growth rather than preventing progression. A bit like the bank manager who lends an umbrella when the sun is shining, and wants it back when it starts to rain, minoxidil works better before you go bald. Men who still have hair regrow more hair than men who have lost it all.\nWhen used together, the combination of minoxidil and finasteride is a man's best chance to both arrest hair loss progression and maximise hair regrowth.\nMen whose hair is too far gone to be saved by tablets and lotions might consider hair transplantation surgery, a cosmetic surgical procedure that has improved dramatically in recent years.\nVarious techniques are available, but all involve taking hair-bearing skin from one part of the scalp and grafting these pieces of skin onto bald or thinning areas of the scalp.\nThe main downside, apart from the cost ($5000 to $10,000, depending on the number of grafts required) is the linear scar left behind on the back of the head, locking men into long-hair styles.\nAnother option is follicular unit extraction. Rather than a strip of skin and a scar, donor tissue comprises multiple tiny punch grafts that heal invisibly by wound contraction. Further dissection of these grafts releases single hair follicle units that can be implanted one by one into the bald scalp to recreate a natural hair line.\nThe only limiting factor for follicular unit extraction is whether there is enough remaining donor hair to transplant. While chest and body hair have been used when donor hair is poor, artificial hair implants, also TGA-approved, remain the last resort. Artificial hairs cover the scalp but do not grow and grey and regenerate like hair transplants.\nWhat about other suggested treatments such as vitamins, dietary supplements, lasers, stem-cell therapy and platelet-rich plasma? At this stage the most generous interpretation of the available data is that they are unproven, expensive and poor value compared with the TGA-approved treatments.\nThe take-home message for boys staring at their bald fathers' scalp and wondering what their genes have in store for them is, don't panic, but don't leave it too late.\nRodney Sinclair is Professor of Dermatology, Honorary, Epworth Hospital at the University of Melbourne."}

Apple told Pocket-lint after the event that the new Apple TV will support third-party gamepads as well.\nDuring our hands-on, we had a look at the SteelSeries Nimbus controller, which can be used to control one player, while the remote, your iPhone, or iPad can be used to control other players.\nApple TV comes with support for Siri, bringing voice-controlled, smart search to the set-top box.\nAll results are sorted by popularity, and when you ask Siri to find a movie, TV show, or song, she'll search not only iTunes, but also Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and HBO. You can also conduct searches by actors and genres. You can say, for instance, \"Show me Bond movies\" or \"Just the ones with Sean Connery.\"\nThis is where things get clever. Apple has quietly included something Google previously described as conversational search. So, you can have a conversation with Siri in order to narrow your choices.\nSiri won't just fetch stuff for you; she'll also scrub for you. She can move whatever you're watching forward or backward. All you have to say is: \"Siri, skip back 15 seconds\" or \"What did he/she say again?\" But if you don't want to use Siri for that, you can also click and slide on the new remote to scrub.\nLet's not forget that Siri is a digital assistant first and foremost, and that's no different with the Apple TV. She can pull up weather reports or answer your questions, and she'll display all answers and results along the bottom of your display. If you want that in full-screen, swipe up on the remote.\nThe new iPhones are capable of recording 4K videos at 30fps, and you'll of course be able to play them on your television through Apple TV, but because the new box doesn't support 4K, all videos will be downgraded to 1080p.\nIt's been rumoured that the new Apple TV would launch with support for HomeKit - Apple's framework that is meant to simplify the current state of home automation. Apple was dodgy when asked directly if it included such integration, though it said HomeKit is in the tvOS SDK for developers.\nSo, theoretically, developers could one day make apps for HomeKit-enabled devices that deliver notification through Apple TV. You might also be able to control those devices using Siri. But that's all just speculation for now.\nIf you lose the new remote to your new Apple TV, you can program any third-party one to work with the set-top box. Just go to Settings > General > Remotes > Learn Remote. From there, choose a setting or button that doesn't control another device, and then select Start. You should see the six buttons of the Apple Remote, which you can map to your new remote. To do so, press and hold each button until the blue progress bar is done.\nIf you share your Apple TV with others, you can set up separate accounts using individual Apple IDs so you don't have to share your content with others. It's simple to do: from the Home screen, go to Settings > Accounts > iTunes and App Store. From there, select Add New Apple ID and enter an Apple ID.\nClick Continue, then add the Apple ID password, and select Sign In. Sign out and repeat the process to add another account, them go to Settings whenever you want to switch between accounts. Simples.\nThe new Apple TV home screen lets you change the default icon order. All you have to do is use the new remote; select an icon by pressing down on the touch surface, and you'll then get vibrating icons (similar to what you see on iOS). Then, you can swipe left, right, up, or down to move the icon around.\nWhen you're done, press the touch surface to set everything in place."}

Michael Quinn Sullivan, leader of the conservative advocacy group Empower Texans, hailed the ongoing discord over tax relief as a sign of how much the Tea Party has come to influence the legislative process.\n\"Today this chamber and this chamber are in a fight over what taxes to cut and who can do the biggest tax cut,\" Sullivan told the activists. \"You are winning.\""}

{"prompt": "An aerial view of the coast near University of Delaware's Hugh R Sharp campus in Lewes.\nNewswise \u2014 As more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the global ocean soaks up much of the excess, storing roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions coming from human activities.\nIn this sense, the ocean has acted as a buffer to slow down the greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and, thus, global warming. However, this process also increases the acidity of seawater and can affect the health of marine organisms and the ocean ecosystem.\nNew research by University of Delaware oceanographer Wei-Jun Cai and colleagues at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, University of Hawaii at Manoa and ETH Zurich, now reveals that the water over the continental shelves is shouldering a larger portion of the load, taking up more and more of this atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nThe study findings, published in Nature Communications on Wednesday, Jan. 31, may have important implications for scientists focused on understanding the", "baseline": "global carbon budget.\nUnderstanding how carbon flows between land, air and water is key to predicting how much greenhouse gas emissions the earth, atmosphere and ocean can tolerate over a given time period to keep global warming and climate change at thresholds considered tolerable.\nThe study authors used recently available and historical data from the past 35 years to calculate global trends of carbon dioxide concentration increases in the coastal ocean. The analysis revealed that, while the amount of carbon dioxide in the open ocean is increasing at the same rate as in the atmosphere, these same carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing slower in the coastal ocean.\n\"This is because the coastal ocean is shallower than the open ocean and can quickly transfer sequestered carbon dioxide to the deep ocean; this process creates an additional and effective pathway for the ocean to take up and store anthropogenic carbon dioxide,\" said Cai, the Mary A.S. Lighthipe Professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment.\nThough relatively small in comparison to the open ocean, the coastal zones are where an extremely large amount of the carbon dioxide is exchanged between air and water.\n\"If this conclusion is confirmed by future observations, it would mean that the coastal ocean will become more and more efficient at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,\" said Goulven Lurallue, the paper's lead author and a researcher with Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.\nUntil recently, these trends were extremely difficult to calculate due to a lack of data about carbon dioxide in coastal waters. Complicating matters further, coastal zones behave differently depending of their location and topography. For example, in higher latitudes such as northern Canada and Greenland, coastal waters usually act as carbon sinks, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In in tropical areas such as the South China Sea, coastal waters are generally considered a source of carbon dioxide.\nAt the same time, human activities have increased the amount of nutrient pollution entering coastal waters from things like fertilizer on land. These nutrients stimulate the growth of algae within the continental shelves, which subsequently removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the researchers said.\nAccording to the research team, this suggests that the continental shelves are becoming a crucial element in the global carbon cycle and for the climate system.\n\"It is important that scientists take into account the contribution of continental shelves to calculate global carbon budgets,\" said Pierre Regnier, professor at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles. \"The possibility of shelves becoming a more important carbon dioxide sink in the future should be considered in global carbon cycle models and flux assessments.\""}

I take the tablets with me on trips to prevent traveler\u2019s diarrhea.\nPepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) has been shown to control the odor in flatus. It reduces hydrogen sulfide (the smelly stuff) from the colon quite dramatically (Gastroenterology, May 1998).\nRegular use of Pepto-Bismol could be problematic, though.

They had already started to blister when I remembered reading about the soy sauce remedy. It was like magic: both the pain and the blisters went away quickly. The next day, I just had two small red marks.\nI\u2019ve been fascinated with this. When my son got his fourth huge mosquito bite of the week, I wondered if soy sauce might help reduce the swelling. His eye had swollen shut from a bite on his forehead, so when he was bitten on the cheek, I applied some soy sauce to it.\nWithin minutes, the swelling had receded, and it was completely invisible before he went to bed. Everyone should have soy sauce packets in his or her first-aid kit!\nThank you for the hint on mosquito bites. We\u2019ve never heard that soy sauce might help.\nMy 92-year-old mom began having excruciating ankle pain about four months ago. She has seen five doctors, including three podiatrists, and a chiropractor, and had an emergency-room visit. They all said her pain was due to osteoarthritis or plantar fasciitis.\nWhile researching ankle pain, I discovered that gout can sometimes affect other joints besides the big toe, and that celery seed extract may be helpful. I bought some for my mother, and after a week or two, she says her ankle pain is gone, although she still has occasional shooting pains into her big toe.\nI feel better having her on celery seed extract rather than the ibuprofen she was taking. We were both worried about the possible side effects of that drug.\nGout can indeed affect other joints besides the big toe, and the pain can be excruciating. Many medications can raise uric-acid levels and increase the likelihood of developing gout.\nDrugs to lower uric-acid levels can help manage gout. Celery seed extract and tart cherries are home remedies for gout, and celery seed has anti-inflammatory effects (Inflammopharmacology, December 2003)."}

{"prompt": "PROFESSOR Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University may now stand as a scientific legend alongside the likes of Newton, Oppenheimer and Einstein.\nBut the Noble laureate-in-waiting is far from the only Scottish scientist behind one of the greatest achievements in physics in the last century: the discovery last week of the elusive Higgs boson \u2013 the God particle. Although Higgs proposed the theory of the particle nearly 50 years ago, behind the scenes, dozens of physicists from Scotland played a vital role in the experiments which led to the identification of the Higgs boson \u2013 a particle which holds the key to explaining how matter attains its mass, and how the universe works at its most fundamental level.\nThe discovery awaits full endorsement from the scientific community.\nAround 50 academics, researchers, technicians and postgraduate students from both Glasgow and Edinburgh universities were part of the Atlas experiment team at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern, Switzerland, which announced the breakthrough on Wednesday.\nHere we talk to some of those Scottish scientists about their work on the Atlas", "baseline": "experiment and their thoughts on the significance of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson particle.\nRobson, 32, is a lecturer in physics at Glasgow University and first started working on the Atlas project when he was a student.\nHe analyses data from Atlas \u2013 an essential part of proving a discovery is bona fide.\nRobson said finding the new particle was a \"huge milestone\". While the world is celebrating the achievement, scientists are a lot more reserved. The discovery is yet to be fully signed-off in scientific terms, and it is Robson's role to make sure it is.\nHe said: \"We have discovered a new particle, but have really still to show that it is a Higgs boson. First of all the challenge is to collect a lot more of these particles, so we can make really precise measurements and see whether the particle does have the properties that the theory predicts \u2013 or whether it is actually something a bit more exotic.\"\nRobson said the \"scientific quest\" had produced huge benefits along the way, including hopefully encouraging more young people into physics. He said: \"Along the way to discovering [the Higgs boson] we have had to overcome all sorts of technological hurdles and that is what has the real effect on everyday life. Whether it is detectors with medical or security applications, or touch screens \u2013 which were first made at Cern to control the accelerators \u2013 all these 'by-products' do have a huge effect on everyday life.\n\"Students coming in to study physics at university say it's the big science, the particle physics and the astronomy that really excites them. I hope they will see that we are making huge advances in our knowledge in particle physics and it is an exciting time to be doing it.\"\nMartin, 38, is a lecturer in particle physics, involved in experiments at Cern and a former student of Higgs.\nShe co-leads the team in Edinburgh University which has been involved in analysing the data collected in the Atlas experiment to search for signs of the Higgs boson.\nShe said: \"This is a fantastic moment. So many people have worked on it for so long. There is a phrase \u2013 we have only seen further because we were standing on the shoulders of giants \u2013 and it really feels like that.\"\nAs an undergraduate student Martin was lectured by Higgs and remembers him as being a \"tough, no-nonsense\" but inspirational teacher.\nShe said that to her there were as yet no apparent practical consequences as a result the discovery of the Higgs boson particle but pointed out there had been huge benefits as a result of the building of the experiment.\nShe said: \"For scientists it is really exciting to complete this picture in their head, but on the way to building the LHC and running it and operating it, there has been so many technological spin-offs which the public use nowadays.\n\"The most common one is the world wide web, which everybody uses, but was invented as a tool for physicists at Cern to communicate with each other.\"\nMartin said another recent development was improved solar panels, based on new vacuum technology created to extract air particles in the LHC. She said: \"These have been installed on the roof of Geneva airport and they are much more efficient than the solar panels that had been developed up until then.\"\nDoyle, 49, Cern associate from Glasgow University, is in charge of the publications from the Atlas experiment.\nHe is currently working on submitting the results of the discovery of the Higgs boson to journal Physics Letter B, which will be published at the end of July.\nDoyle said scientists from Glasgow University had been involved in the hunt for the Higgs boson particle for around 20 years, with the current team involving 35 people \u2013 a relatively large group.\nHe said: \"Within the collaboration there are 3,000 [researchers] at 175 institutes worldwide, so it is an average number of 15 or so in a team.\n\"Our group is more than double the size of the average group. It is because we have been working on lots of elements and we have led the way in which all the data is analysed and distributed all over the world.\"\nDoyle was at the seminar last Wednesday when the results were announced and said it was unlike any previous scientific event he had attended.\n\"It was like a rock concert, everyone was queuing up,\" he said. \"Not everyone could fit into the auditorium, as there are thousands of people here. So there were different rooms which were being used around Cern to show it.\"\nDoyle likened the process of searching for the Higgs boson to the space mission which was a test run for Apollo 11's successful moon landing.\nHe added: \"My analogy is that last year was like Apollo 10, where we developed the technologies that we required. Now the eagle has landed.\"\nClark, 38, is reader in physics at Edinburgh University, another former student of Higgs and a key scientist on the Atlas project at Cern.\nHe also played a key role in the development of a computer system called Scotgrid, a joint enterprise along with the universities of Glasgow and Durham, which enables vast quantities of data from the experiments to be sent around the world to researchers.\nHe said: \"All the computers around the world are hooked up to the experiment software. We run continually about 120,000 computer programmes across the world to simulate the particles that are produced at the LHC and also to analyse the data.\"\nClark said it was difficult to predict the future potential of the Higgs boson discovery, but pointed out the implications of great scientific breakthroughs in the past had been similarly unknown.\nHe said: \"It just gives us so much more understanding of the fundamental particle interactions, and how they actually come about.\n\"To relate that to everyday life is really quite difficult and it could be very far into the future when we find there is something we haven't thought of.\n\"For example, when the electron was discovered, we didn't think about the whole internet revolution that is completely dependent upon the electron 100 years later.\nOf the Higg's boson's significance he said: \"I think I would liken [this discovery] to finally understanding the DNA mechanism, in that the scientific achievement is of similar scale.\"\nSt Denis, 52, senior lecturer in experimental particle physics at Glasgow University, has been involved in the project since 1991, when he helped to design what would eventually become the Atlas experiment.\nHe said it was difficult to envisage the application of such scientific theories, but pointed out they often had an impact on everyday life.\nHe said: \"Einstein's theory of relativity is one you might have thought was a bit of an esoteric thing \u2013 what could that have to do with my life?\n\"The answer is in your cellphone and your satnav. Your position locator will not work without it as if you tried to do the calculations without general relativity it wouldn't find you.\"\nSt Denis said the discovery of the Higgs boson had triggered discussion and excitement equivalent to the first moon landing.\n\"The way to describe this is that it is like the Lord of the Rings \u2013 one particle shall rule them all,\" he said.\nHe said the importance of the Higgs boson discovery was comparable to the work of Sir Isaac Newton, who \"made sense out of complete chaos and explained how planets move and at the same time explained how an apple fell. I think that is the level we are at with this.\"\nAlthough the Higgs boson has been nicknamed the \"God particle\", because of its fundamental role in answering questions about the creation of the universe, St Denis said its discovery would not impact on anyone's religious beliefs, adding: \"It strikes me as a term that was invented to be a little devilish.\"\nButtar, 49, is group leader of the Atlas project at Glasgow University and a reader in the university's school of physics and astronomy.\nHe started working on the Atlas project in around 1990, helping to build the experiment and develop a \"tracker\" at the centre of the Atlas detector to collect data and find the particle.\nButtar said the discovery of the particle which appears to be the Higgs boson could be the \"last part of the jigsaw\".\n\"One of the critical things is going to be to start looking at this and to check it is a Higgs,\" he said.\n\"The chances are it is a Higgs, but science has got to be more rigorous than that and we have got to go and do the measurements. That is going to take a while.\" Buttar pointed out that the search for the Higgs boson was not the only purpose of the LHC, which is going to be shut down next year to allow final repairs to be carried out following an accident four years ago.\nA fault caused helium to leak into the tunnel that houses the collider, just nine days after it was switched on in September 2008.\nButtar said: \"We have found the Higgs \u2013 that was definitely the main target \u2013 and in the next few years we have got to confirm it is the Higgs and what its properties are.\n\"The LHC will shut down next year and they are going to do the final repairs \u2013 when it comes back on its energy will have doubled.\n\"That will give us approximately double the reach in terms of looking for new phenomena.\"\nHe added: \"It is a bit like a telescope \u2013 the Higgs is one of the big name items we are after, but there are many, many things going on at the same time.\"\nProfessor Peter Higgs, 83, came up with his theory while working as a researcher at Edinburgh University.\nAn honorary Scot, he was born in Newcastle and graduated with a first-class honours degree in physics from King's College London.\nHe moved to Edinburgh in 1960 to lecture in mathematical physics \u2013 a city which he had grown to love after once hitch-hiking to the Edinburgh Festival.\nThe scientist hit upon the concept of the Higgs boson while walking in the Cairngorms in 1964 and returned to his lab declaring he had had his \"one big idea\".\nThat moment has led to numerous accolades and he is now in line to win the Nobel prize.\nBut he has spoken of the toll his search to understand the building blocks of the universe has taken, with the stress of his work leading to the breakdown of his marriage to American wife, Jodie, in 1972.\nHe has previously said: \"We split up because I had put my science career above the family. I backed out of a family holiday when we were meant to be going to America. Then I got on a plane and went to a conference.\"\nThe notoriously shy professor retired in 1996 and became emeritus professor of physics at Edinburgh University.\nHe lives in the capital's New Town and doesn't have a television or use a computer \u2013 someone else checks his email for him \u2013 and rarely answers the phone.\nIn typically unassuming manner, when asked about his reaction to the discovery which is likely to confirm his life's work, his answer was: \"It's very nice to be right sometimes.\""}

{"prompt": "Put it down to weird-word mind glut. I admit to confusion. And if you are like me, Toyota and Nissan have a problem with their blockbuster entries in the luxury-car sweepstakes.\nI have immersed myself in the two cars and still have to think twice before I know that Nissan makes Lexus and Toyota makes Infiniti, or vice versa.\nVice versa wins (I stopped to think), but the befuddlement over names may be the only serious difficulty that Toyota has with its new Lexus.\nSeveral weeks ago I was in love with Infiniti and now my fickle heart has been won by the only serious competition. When you get behind the wheel of a Lexus you can pretty much forget everything else in the luxury class.\nYou can certainly pay more, and you can maybe get a ''better'' car in the BMW 7-series. You can have more oohs and ahhs and fingerprints on the paint with a Rolls or a Bentley Turbo. But nobody else is offering a steal quite like the Toyota Lexus LS 400, which", "baseline": "has a base sticker of $35,000 and will cost about $40,000 by the time you get it home.\nYes, that is a lot of money. But these are the days of $20,000 Hondas, $25,000 Fords and $28,000 Oldsmobiles, and the 40 big ones are well spent if you are in the market for an automotive bargain.\nFirst off, there is the technology. The car has an all-aluminum V8 that is so quiet you will try to start it when it is already running. The transmission is a four-speed overdrive automatic that is among the smoothest ever. And then there is Traction Control, which means the rear wheels never spin, despite the engine's oomph.\nTraction Control acts like a limited-slip differential, but better. It uses the car's standard antilock brake system, in tandem with an engine computer that closes a throttle valve to reduce power when wheel spin is imminent.\nThe engine itself is a masterpiece, with four cams and 32 valves. Its 4 liters develop 250 horsepower, a bit less than Nissan's Infiniti, but it moves the 3,759-pound sedan from zero to 60 in about eight seconds, and top speed is rated by the factory at 150 miles an hour.\nEven with that kind of performance though, the sophisticated power plant delivers fuel economy on the order of 17 miles a gallon, city, and 23, highway. Because of the V8's high (10-to-1) compression ratio, you'll have to pull up to the premium pump, and a fill-up will take 22.5 gallons. Given the car's range, the good news is that you won't have to make the visit very often.\nTwo suspension systems are offered, with the option of coil springs or air bladders. The air springs are a version of Toyota's ''FXV-II'' concept-car suspension system, and a change in driving conditions creates an automatic adjustment to minimize roll, dive and squat. The system also compensates for rough roads, reducing bounce and pitch. And it lowers the car at high speeds for better aerodynamics.\nEven without that, the aerodynamics are as good as any in the business. The Lexus has a conservatively beautiful body whose rounded contours produce a coefficent of drag of only .29. And the interior is the exterior's equal.\nToyota has taken bits and pieces from hither and yon, and the car has almost everything. What it doesn't have is the four-wheel steering offered by Infiniti, and if you need to turn on a dime then you ought to buy Nissan. Otherwise, Toyota has it all, from power headrests to a flat emergency key for your newly depleted wallet.\nLeather costs $1,400, and Traction Control will be another $900. A 140-watt Pioneer sound system, which features a six-disk CD changer in the low-liftover trunk, is the basic audio equipment, but you can get a 220-watt Nakamichi system if you really want to one-up the world.\nAnother nice interior feature is the computer that memorizes preferred positions for the driver's seat, the sideview mirrors, the adjustable seat-belt anchor and the wheel, which courteously moves up and out of the way when you remove the ignition key.\nThe leather-wrapped wheel also has power controls to make it tilt and telescope. Maybe the best thing about the wheel, though, is the horn, which is proper and safe. Unlike all the other cars with airbags in the hub of the wheel, there are no tiny and hard-to-find buttons. Toyota has found a way to make the entire hub serve as the button.\nAnd then there is the dashboard, as good looking as any I've seen. The instrument panel uses lighted white needles and white digits behind smoked glass. The analog gauges are complimented by warning lights as usual, but this time the lights are projected onto the smoked glass to catch the driver's attention, a nice piece of technology that imparts a three-dimensional feel.\nAmong the gauges is a 160-m.p.h. speedometer, and Toyota says each car is tested at something more than 100 m.p.h. before it goes into the showroom. The point, the company adds, is that capability at such speeds translates into superb performance in the low and mid-ranges.\nNeither Lexus nor Infiniti has any trouble achieving speeds that will irritate the troopers, but there is a very different feel to the two sedans.\nInfiniti is stiffer, more like Mercedes. Lexus is silkier. But both are super cars and the price is much the same. You just have to remember which is which."}

The guys on the bench lifted the team and crowd.\"\nSwansea were positive with their approach but a long-range effort from Wilfried Bony, parried by Joe Hart, in the first half was the best they had to show for their endeavour.\nHome fans chanted \"sacked in the morning\" at Bil", "baseline": "ic when his side trailed 3-0 in a 3-2 defeat by Tottenham last weekend.\nFor the most of this contest there was little respite for the Croat as his side laboured against a disciplined and organised Swansea side.\nIndeed there were jeers and boos for Bilic's double substitution when Masuaku and Sakho were introduced for Javier Hernandez and Andre Ayew.\nUltimately, the 49-year-old's decision to throw on both players made the difference, though, as Masuaku's superb run and cross found Sakho's perfectly timed run.\nWith West Ham's next three matches against Burnley, Brighton and Crystal Palace, Bilic will hope the confidence from this victory can spur his side on to greater things.\nSwansea managed just 10 shots on target before this encounter, which head coach Paul Clement blamed on a hectic end to the transfer window.\nTheir play was largely tidy and they used the ball intelligently, with Renato Sanches in particular catching the eye for the visitors.\nHowever, there was a stark lack of cutting edge to Swansea's play.

She provided info on all of her employees, asking them for information under the ruse that it was for the company Facebook page. It was narrowed down to three women, all single moms, and the producer recorded video of them, saying it was a company video.\nSimmons' sister, Glori Nicholson, who was also in the video praising her and who was \"pranked\" with a trip with her sister to Mexico, also works at Maid Brite and was one of the finalists.

{"prompt": "Although the recently leaked audio of Hillary Clinton speaking to campaign donors back in February about her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his basement-dwelling millennial supporters is hardly as damning as some have suggested, it does serve as an important reminder of the sharp divisions that surfaced during the Democratic primaries between progressives and Democratic partisans, and why many Sanders supporters remain deeply skeptical of Clinton one month before the presidential election.\nClinton, who admits in one of the soundbites to occupying \u201cthe center-left to the center-right\u201d of the political spectrum, comes across as mildly condescending \u2014 yet also sympathetic \u2014 to Sanders\u2019 millennial base. None of what she says is at all surprising, and most of her commentary is accurate when it comes to understanding why so many millennials supported the democratic socialist.\nClinton, ever the realist, goes on to call Sanders\u2019 entire campaign a \u201cfalse promise,\u201d and mockingly remarks that she is still trying to figure out what he means by a \"political revolution.\"\nEight", "baseline": "months later, many people continue to misconstrue what Sanders meant by calling for a political revolution, and assume \u2014 like Clinton \u2014 that the senator\u2019s campaign was pie in the sky idealism at best, demagoguery at worst.\nOf course, while Sanders had a historic run, he didn't win the nomination \u2014 and many of his younger supporters remain bitter about this fact (especially after it was revealed that the DNC has been pulling for Clinton behind the scenes). Recent polling shows that Clinton continues to be very unpopular with millennials, albeit not quite as unpopular as the Donald, whose blatant xenophobia and sexism are repellent to most people under 30. Millennial voters (18-29) dislike both Clinton and Trump so much that only 41 percent of them say that they are certain to vote in November, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll from last week. The survey also found that under-30 voters prefer Clinton over Trump by only 2 points, compared to a 30-point preference for President Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012.\nSo did the Sanders campaign simply bring about more disillusionment and cynicism among young voters? And was the senator making false promises that he knew he couldn\u2019t keep?\nThis is essentially what Sanders meant by a political revolution, and it\u2019s a message that has long been espoused by those on the left, from socialists and anarchists to unionists and civil rights activists. Put simply, political and social change is in the hands of the people, and no meaningful or radical reform will happen as long as the populace passively accepts the status quo and assumes that revolving-door bureaucrats and billionaire-backed politicians have their interests at heart.\nHillary Clinton takes more of a top-down approach to politics, and gladly stands in the political center (leaning more toward the left or right depending on who she\u2019s talking to). The former secretary of state considers Sanders\u2019 populism naive and unrealistic, and accepts the technocratic method that has dominated the Democratic Party for the past 30 years.\nBut what exactly has modern technocratic liberalism achieved? Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s most important achievements \u2014 most notably the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are also some of the most jumbled, bureaucratic and corporate-friendly pieces of legislation in modern history (Bill Clinton slipped up a few days ago when he called Obamacare the \"craziest thing in the world,\" which he has since walked back). A fine example of the technocratic liberal is MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who said in 2014 that \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d and that \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d was critical for ACA to pass.\nOf course, this kind of convoluted legislation, watered down by special interest demands and intentionally opaque, is almost inevitable in the current political system. And this is exactly why Sanders was calling for a popular movement to combat the status quo. It is naive to think that revolving-door bureaucrats and politicians desperate for campaign cash would ever agree to radical reform without a popular movement demanding it from below. With this in mind, is it not more accurate to describe Sanders as a realist than a utopian?"}

But after attending Columbia University\u2019s 2017 Age Boom Academy program for journalists, Exploring Inequities in Health, Work and Retirement, I\u2019ve learned how difficult (if not impossible) that can be for many of them.\nBut I also learned from the international Age Boom Academy experts that there are a few things employers, the U.S. government and older workers could do to make staying employed for additional years of our longer lives a more likely reality. The time is right: By 2020, one in four American workers will be over 55.\nBut just imagine the payoffs if the nation made it easier for people who are physically and mentally able to continue working to do so.\nFor those staying in the workforce: better health (cognitive and physical) and finances, more social engagement and higher life satisfaction \u201cEarly retirement appears to have a significant negative impact on the cognitive ability of", "baseline": "people in their early 60s,\u201d wrote Age Boom Academy speakers Susann Rohwedder, associate director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging and Robert J. Willis, a University of Michigan economics professor, in a 2010 academic article. And \u201ccomplete retirement leads to a 23% to 29% increase in difficulties associated with mobility and daily activities,\u201d according to a paper by Ursula Staudinger, founding director of the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center; Age Boom Academy director Ruth Finkelstein and other researchers.\nThe financial payoff \u2014 from additional years of salary and, ideally, retirement plan contributions \u2014 is obvious, if sometimes overlooked. \u201cWe too often frame the conversation about finding purpose in later life, rather than economic survival,\u201d said Finkelstein, who is associate director of the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center.\nWorking longer, said Axel B\u00f6rsch-Supan of the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging, also may make you happier. He cited research showing that people who retired early wish they\u2019d retired 1.8 years later, on average. \u201cPeople regret retiring too early,\u201d he noted.\nFor the U.S. government: more income taxes, Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and a stronger economy The longer people continue working, the more they provide tax revenues and the more they're likely to spend.\n\u201cWe have longer lives, so let\u2019s use them,\u201d said Staudinger, a Columbia professor of sociomedical sciences and psychology.\nWhat follows are a few things that would help Americans work longer and delay full-stop retirement, if they want and can, based on research and insights dispensed at Age Boom Academy. In coming weeks, you\u2019ll see more about work, health and retirement from my Next Avenue colleagues Emily Gurnon, Kerry Hannon and Chris Farrell, who also attended the program.\nOnly 5% of U.S. companies offered a formal phased retirement program, according to the 2016 Society for Human Resource Management survey. Phased retirement is one of the 10 \u201cage smart policies and practices\u201d on Finkelstein\u2019s list of them. \u201cFlexibility\u201d is another.\nMake jobs less routine and more interesting for older workers. \u201cSmall changes in repetitive jobs can make a big effect in the cognitive health of older workers,\u201d said Staudinger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for employers to keep motivation up by giving workers interesting jobs. That makes you more productive as you age,\u201d said B\u00f6rsch-Supan. \u201cProductivity declines for people with routine jobs, like opening letters.\u201d Let the robots do those tasks; increasingly, they can. In Germany\u2019s auto and insurance industries, B\u00f6rsch-Supan said, employers intentionally retool their workers to keep them current and enthusiastic.\nMake workspaces more amenable to older workers, especially blue-collar ones. BMW famously spent just $50,000 to overhaul one of its assembly lines in 2007 and make it more older-worker friendly (adding chairs, enlarging computer screen typefaces, that sort of thing). Productivity rose 7% and absenteeism dropped from 7% to 2%.\n\u201cHealth and safety protections might make work less odious,\u201d said Finkelstein. Staudinger cited a study where workers in physically strenuous settings were given 20 minutes of daily physical therapy exercises, which resulted in reduced sick days. \u201cThe benefit was way more than the investment,\u201d she added.\nBegin an end to the time-honored seniority pay structure. Granted, it would be highly controversial not to pay people more for each year they work at an employer. But it may be time to consider this switch, as has been happening in Japan. Perhaps the way to start would be on a pro-rata basis, with older employees who move from full-time to part-time work at their firms or nonprofits.\nThis change in thinking about pay could help prevent managers from getting rid of otherwise valuable full-time workers in their 50s and 60s merely because they cost more than those in their 20s, 30s and 40s.\nChange the Medicare rules for people working after 65. Under current law, if an employer has 20 or more employees, its group health plan generally pays health benefits for workers 65 and older first and Medicare kicks in for coverage after that. That\u2019s a strong disincentive for employers to retain or hire workers 65 or older. \u201cI\u2019m an expensive employee,\u201d said Willis, 76, noting that the University of Michigan pays for his health insurance.\nPass age discrimination legislation to prevent employers from getting off the hook so easily. As Age Boom participant and ProPublica reporter Peter Gosselin has written zealously lately, a 2009 Supreme Court ruling (Gross v. FBL Financial Services) has made it near impossible to win an age-discrimination case. The Gross decision said an employee who thinks he was a victim of age discrimination must show he wouldn\u2019t have suffered it \u201cbut for\u201d his age.\n\u201cAge discrimination remains widespread and difficult to challenge, 50 years after the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\u201d said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the City University of New York.\nGonzales and his colleagues have created a Workforce Age Discrimination Scale which determined that age discrimination is significantly related to an increased desire to retire among older workers.\nThink more entrepreneurial. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean leaving your employer to start a business, although that could be worth considering. It\u2019s more about reassessing what Staudinger calls your \u201ccompetency profile\u201d and finding the job that best matches it."}

Amid construction and preparations for this weekend\u2019s Life is Beautiful festival, a group of developers on Tuesday morning cut the ribbon on a new luxury apartment tower.\nRent at Fremont9 ranges from $845 per month for a 395-square-foot studio to $3,961 per month for a 1,330-square-foot three-bedroom apartment. Parking is extra, but residents who fully embrace the Fremont9 ethos won\u2019t be driving that much anyway.\nIf it seems unusual to", "baseline": "have a music festival going up across the street from a housing complex, that\u2019s a feature not a bug of Fremont9. Every resident receives a free pass to the festival. Located at 901 Fremont Street, on the corner of Fremont Street and 9th Street, Fremont9 is built for residents who want to be surrounded by hip downtown bars and restaurants.\nFremont9 came about as a partnership between the Downtown Project, which owned the land, and real estate investors the Wolff Co., which took the lead on bringing the project to fruition. Construction costs were $43 million to $44 million, said Nate Carlson of the Wolff Co.\nThe roughly 15,000 square feet of retail space is ready and waiting to host those three Cs. On the day of ribbon cutting, expansive floor-to-ceiling windows on the ground floor revealed empty space inside, pure possibility.\n\u201cThe space can be devised to accommodate different tenants. Currently, it is open so that they do not limit the tenants they can work with,\u201d says Fremont9 spokesperson Megan Fazio, who notes that leasing is still in the early stages because the opening is so recent.\nA grocery store would be an ideal tenant. Within walking distance, the Market on 611 Fremont Street has downsized its grocery options to make room for Bronze Cafe. The Family Food Mart on 1102 Fremont Street is also within walking distance, but it is no luxury bodega.\nMeanwhile, established local retailers are thrilled about the planned influx of well-heeled residents. Cathy Brooks of Hydrant Club, a dog daycare on 109 N. 9th Street, says she has been eagerly awaiting Fremont9's opening since the groundbreaking. The property allows dogs under a certain weight.\nOne type of retail that won\u2019t be found at Fremont9 is A\u200ci\u200cr\u200cb\u200cn\u200cb\u200c. Just like subleasing, it\u2019s forbidden by property management. This is in contrast with nearby condo tower The Ogden (150 N. Las Vegas Blvd.), which because it is owner-occupied has a variety of units available on A\u200ci\u200cr\u200cb\u200cn\u200cb\u200c.\nIn line with the national trend of builders focusing on the high-end market, which includes the recently opened Lotus LV in Chinatown, Fremont9 offers a host of enviable amenities. There are stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops and built-in blackout shades to match the oversized windows. In addition to a pool and yoga room, the fitness room features a wooden floor reclaimed from a high school gym. Hand-painted murals add an artsy allure to common areas. The Wolff Co.\u2019s Nate Carlson says that the edgy vibe was carefully curated to foster a sense of creativity that aligns with downtown.\nAdditional amenities include common rooms with a video wall, a music wall, billiards and a TopBrewer brand app-powered espresso machine. There\u2019s an \u201centertainment kitchen\u201d and \u201ccommunity dining space.\u201d Interior courtyards have bocce ball, ping pong and barbecue grills. Bicycle storage and 24/7 on-demand parcel lockers complete the urban lifestyle.\nSo much luxury does not come cheap, and the central downtown location comes at an extra price. Luxury apartments elsewhere in the valley are significantly less expensive. A 1,440-sqare-foot unit at Elysian at The District rents for $2,522 per month, which is nearly $1,500 less than a comparable unit at Fremont9. Apartments at The Well in Henderson\u2019s Union Village, which are also owned by The Wolff Group, range from $1,051 for 465 square feet to $1,977 for 1,201 square feet.\nUrban living giveth and taketh away. The advantage of living downtown comes in the form of walkability. The disadvantage of high-density living is the loss of free parking. A parking space at Fremont9 will set residents back another $100-$250 per month, depending on whether they choose a garage or carport. Residents who prefer a more budget option are encouraged to rent a space from the nearby municipal \u201cLlama Lot.\u201d Or they can always try their luck finding a free space on the street.\nPotential residents have not been deterred. Carlson says that in 30 days of being open, the property has become about 37 to 38 percent occupied.\nDowntown Project executive vice president of operations Michael Downs is most proud of the location of Fremont9 and how the property is helping transform the area. In addition to new construction, Downs says that the Downtown Project is working to capitalize on demand for housing by renovating properties they already own.\nAbout a block away from Fremont9 is the 10-unit Nolana, which Downs said became 100 percent occupied within a month of going on the market. DTP is also working on renovations of Fergusons and the Downtowner, which will become mixed-use spaces. The newly renovated Cassia, an 18-unit apartment complex on 9th street and Bridger, will open next week."}

{"prompt": "HELENA, Mont. \u2014 U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte is pinning his third campaign in two years on Montana residents being better off economically since President Donald Trump took office and that the voters will give him some of the credit.\nGianforte has tied his political fortunes to Trump as he seeks his first full term in Montana's only House seat. He won a special election last year to serve the remainder of Ryan Zinke's term after Zinke resigned to become Interior Department secretary.\nGianforte has had to fend off renewed criticism over his assault on Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs the day before that special election. His Democratic opponent, Kathleen Williams, has made it a campaign issue, and Trump praised him for it during a recent rally.\nThe entrepreneur-turned-politician initially gave a tepid endorsement of the president during a failed campaign for governor in the same 2016 Montana election that Trump won in a landslide, then found himself on the winning side in the 2017 special election when he became a full-throated Trump supporter.\n\"", "baseline": "Thank God Donald Trump is our president,\" Gianforte said to cheers during a recent rally in East Helena. \"You know why we're doing this. In America, we've always believed that if you work hard, follow the rules and persevere, you can make a better life for yourself. That's the American dream. \"\nGianforte has centered his campaign on emphasizing his 16 months in office and telling voters that he's working hand in hand with the president.\nHe's cited his trips on Air Force One and visits to the Oval Office. His speeches are peppered with \"we\" and \"us\" when he talks about the economy, as in, \"We've gotten the economy going,\" and \"We now have more jobs open in the country than people looking for work,\" as he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\nWilliams, a former state lawmaker and water specialist for state government and a nonprofit organization, said she doesn't believe Gianforte's time in office gives him an advantage.\n\"He's hiding behind his incumbency. Well \u2014 he's barely an incumbent,\" she told the AP. \"He hasn't done that much. So, I don't think it's a disadvantage at all.\"\nWilliams was the only woman running in a crowded Democratic primary in June, beating out two better-funded men in a year that has seen a record number of women running for office.\nShe is seeking to become the first Democrat to hold the House seat since Pat Williams left in 1997. She also would be the first woman to hold the office since Jeannette Rankin left in 1943.\nLibertarian Elinor Swanson is also on the ballot.\nWilliams, 57, has centered her campaign on the themes of improving health care and access to it, along with protecting the environment and Montana's outdoor heritage. In a dig at Trump and Gianforte, she also says restoring civility and integrity to Congress and restoring America's place in the world are among her top priorities.\nGianforte, 57, is a technology entrepreneur who turned to politics after selling his software company, RightNow Technologies, to Oracle for $1.8 billion in 2011. He says his top issues are undoing Obama-era regulations in a bid to promote economic growth, improving community safety by addressing the methamphetamine crisis, protecting gun rights and increasing access to public lands.\nWilliams has steadily been attacking Gianforte's record. In October, she stepped up those attacks to include the assault against Jacobs last year.\nGianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for throwing the reporter to the ground when he tried to ask the candidate a question.\nWilliams released an ad with audio of the assault taken from Jacobs' recorder on the same day that Trump praised Gianforte for the attack, thrusting it back into the spotlight in the final weeks of the campaign.\nIt received additional attention when Jacobs' lawyer sent Gianforte's lawyer a letter accusing the congressman of lying about the attack and mischaracterizing the terms of a settlement.\nGianforte also ratcheted up his political attacks. His campaign has sent out daily statements that call Williams \"extreme\" on various issues and released an ad tying her to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whom Williams said she wouldn't support if elected.\nGianforte says Williams has misrepresented his record, especially when accusing him of not meeting with constituents. He cites telephone conferences with them and regular radio appearances as examples of his accessibility.\n\"I think it's a false narrative being promoted by my opponent to try and create a wedge, and frankly, it's not true,\" he said.\nWilliams said Gianforte has distorted her positions, falsely saying she opposes gun rights, and that Montana voters will be able to see through him.\n\"Apparently, he's desperate for power,\" Williams said of the new attacks. \"Montanans value truth and integrity and honesty.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assumes the Bank of Canada will go ahead with an increase later this month and then follow that move with another one in January, earlier than its previous forecast. Derek Burleton of Toronto-Dominion Bank also said a hike on Oct. 24 was \u201cvirtually cemented\u201d and that the smart money now is on three additional increases next year, rather than two.\nThe reason the professional forecasters pivoted so quickly was because logic was on their side.

Faster growth would spark faster inflation, leaving Canada\u2019s central bank with little choice but to raise interest rates to constrain prices.\n\u201cWe continue to expect the Bank of Canada to resume monetary policy tightening on Oct. 24 in a context where it is hard to justify keeping interest rates below inflation now that uncertainty surrounding U.S.-Canada trade has dissipated,\u201d Matthieu Arseneau of National Bank Financial said on Oct. 5 after Statistics Canada\u2019s latest hiring survey showed the unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 per cent in September, one of the lowest levels on record.\nAll that makes sense. Still, let\u2019s pump the brakes a little. It\u2019s too soon to predict with so much certainty that the new NAFTA will alter Canada\u2019s interest-rate path. It\u2019s possible Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t changed much of anything.\nWhat was the surprise on Oct. 1? The introduction of a statute that would give Washington influence over Canada\u2019s dealings with China came out of nowhere, that\u2019s for sure. But most, including Stephen Poloz, the Bank of Canada governor, assumed the talks themselves would get sorted.\nBefore this week, the prevailing assumption was that failure to resolve NAFTA by the Sept. 30 deadline set by the Trump administration would have forced Poloz and his deputies to leave the benchmark rate unchanged on Oct. 24, like they did at the previous policy meeting in September.\nActually, that would have depended on market reaction and feedback from the central bank\u2019s contacts in the real economy. Policymakers have stated explicitly that they intend to raise interest rates gradually, and the data since its pause on Sept. 5 have been fairly strong. The Bank of Canada estimates that a \u201cnormal\u201d benchmark interest rate \u2014 one that neither encourages borrowing nor impedes it \u2014 is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. That\u2019s still a long way from where the benchmark rate is now, so policymakers might have been prepared to raise rates even if negotiations had collapsed.\nThe NAFTA talks were noise, not signal; the signal will be in indicators of business investment, and we don\u2019t have those yet. The first good look will come when the Bank of Canada releases its next Business Outlook Survey, on Dec. 21. Policymakers put a lot of weight on that report, but it only reveals intentions. Poloz will want to see evidence of actual spending, too, and that will require patience. Consider: David Bensadoun, chief executive of ALDO Group Inc., told me in an interview last month that it would take six to nine months for him to simply shift from one supplier in Asia to another. It will be well into 2019 before the central bank decides if it can stop worrying about business investment.\nUnlike most of their counterparts on Bay Street, the economists at RBC Capital Markets were unmoved by the week\u2019s big trade story. Non-energy exports have been slow to catch fire despite a couple of years of strong global demand. Uncertainty is part of the problem, but a bigger one probably is that Canada has been muscled out of its traditional export markets by more aggressive competitors, according to RBC.\nA new free-trade agreement that looks a lot like the old free-trade agreement won\u2019t fix Canada\u2019s competitiveness issues. One of the reasons the Bank of Canada has promised to raise interest rates gradually is because the country\u2019s exporters need a crutch. That didn\u2019t change overnight on Sept. 30."}

{"prompt": "School Shooters Are Rarely Female. What Does That Mean for Schools?\nPolice arrested a 12-year-old girl suspected of shooting two students in the classroom of Salvador Castro Middle School in Los Angeles Thursday morning. Later that evening, they said they believed the shooting was unintentional and that the student had been booked on charges of negligent discharge of a firearm, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nBut before police shared details of the shooting or the suspect's motive, her gender stood out in news reports.\nSchool shooting suspects are almost always male. Why is that? And what does it mean for school safety?\nFor much of the day Thursday, the incident seemed like a typical school shooting, apart from the gender and young age of the suspected shooter.\nA 15-year-old boy was in critical but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the head, and a 15-year-old girl was in fair condition after she was shot in the wrist, police said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. Three others, an adult and two students, suffered more minor abrasion injuries", "baseline": ", the Los Angeles Times reported.\nPolice later said they believed the girl discharged the semiautomatic handgun unintentionally.\n\"\u200b\u200b\u200bSomeone decided to bring a gun, I guess someone was accidentally playing around with it,\" a student told the Times. \"They thought it was a fake gun.\"\nPolice arrested the suspect and evacuated students from the school before launching an investigation. Officials had not named the suspect by Thursday evening.\nWhile it is rare, there have also been female suspects in intentional school shootings.\nThere's a common misconception that school attackers are all young, white, socially isolated men who play too many violent video games. But school safety experts have said that profile is far too narrow and that schools need to be responsive to the safety concerns and social and emotional needs presented by all students to create a safe environment.\nBut it is striking that most school shootings, and most mass shootings in general, are perpetrated by male suspects. An Education Week analysis of news reports found four incidents where at least one person was injured as the result of a shooting at a K-12 school or school-related event in 2018. Of those incidents, only the Los Angeles shooting involved a female suspect. The trend is even starker looking back through years of data collected by other organizations; only a handful of identified suspects are women or girls.\n\"Most violent crime is perpetrated by males,\" said Peter Langman, a psychologist who studies school shootings and has authored several books about them. \"The fact that school shooters are typically male is part of the overall phenomenon of violence being a predominantly male phenomenon.\"\nIn the case of \"rampage shootings,\" perpetrators often have a sense of \"damaged masculinity,\" which Langman defines as a sense of failure or inadequacy in parts of their life that they have linked to male identity, like sexuality or physical strength, he said.\nSome bullying researchers have also said concerns about heterosexual, masculine gender norms can feed bullying problems among male students. They've urged schools to adopt bullying policies that prohibit harassment on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\"There is actually no stereotype,\" Dewey Cornell, the director of the Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia said in 2014. \"There is a human tendency to look for predictive factors, but if we apply those to the general population, we will find many false positives.\"\n\"A 2002 report by the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center, prepared after the agency analyzed 37 school attacks that occurred between 1974 and 2000, concluded that \"there is no accurate or useful 'profile' of students who engaged in targeted school violence.\"\nActs of school violence have been carried out by attackers of all races, ages, disciplinary histories, and family backgrounds. And, though perpetrators are typically male, women have also played roles in mass attacks, experts on such incidents say.\nIn the events analyzed, attackers fell all along the social spectrum, from popular students to \"loners,\" the Secret Service report said.\nWhile the agency didn't find common demographic threads, it did note some psychological trends among attackers: Many \"felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack,\" many had a history of suicide attempts or feelings of depression or desperation, and most had no history of criminal behavior.\nAnd, in 31 of the 37 events studied by the Secret Service, shooters told at least one person about their plans beforehand, the report said. Threat-assessment experts say that such \"leakage\" is common, and that attackers often leave more subtle clues that they are distressed, even if they don't explicitly detail their plans in conversations.\"\nSo, while most shooters are male, schools should seek to be aware of the needs of all students, working to create a supportive environment and reduce social isolation, safety experts said. That's because school shooters don't usually \"just snap,\" and often hint at their plans in advance. Addressing school climate concerns is important for the educational success of all students, even if they don't have a violent intent, researchers say.\nPolice provided very few details about the circumstances behind the Los Angeles shooting Thursday, and they did not say if the school had any previous concerns about the student they arrested, how she obtained the weapon, or how she came to fire it in school.\nCornell has worked to develop a threat-assessment model that schools can use to respond to such concerns. Education Week's Lisa Stark recently interviewed Cornell for this piece she did for the PBS Newshour about preventing school violence."}

{"prompt": "We are somewhere in the jungle, deep in the heart of the cinematic and moral darkness that the movie industry has made of Vietnam. We are in the land of \"Rambo: First Blood II\" (citywide). Ominous Jerry Goldsmith music throbs. The air reeks with sweat and tangled foliage. A squad of Soviets is searching for one man, one walking hunk of slaughter and vengeance: John Rambo--beside whom Superman is a wimp and James Bond a Piccadilly hairdresser.\nTheir tread is soft, their faces wary. Rambo, armed with nothing but a knife, and bow and arrow, has already wasted at least a hundred of their best. He is obviously no one to be trifled with.\nOne of the soldiers pauses by an embankment of pure mud. Suddenly, the mud stirs. The mud breathes. The mud glares angrily at the marauding Soviet. The mud reaches out with one tawny mud-arm, throttles the invader and sends a hunting knife deep into his chest. Blood and", "baseline": "mud commingle, and at last we see: This is no ordinary mudbank, this is the indefatigable Rambo, in another of his multitudinous (if muddy) disguises--Rambo the mud-man, battalion of one.\nThe absurdity of this sequence should alert you to the movie surrounding it. \"Rambo\" is an inane sequel to a fairly good melodrama; another example of an attempt to repeat an earlier success that goes wildly out of scale.\nIn \"First Blood,\" Sylvester Stallone's Rambo was a disconsolate Vietnam vet who, pushed too far in a small Northwestern town, battled to the death with its police, and nearly won.\nSomehow--perhaps because of Stallone's taciturn charisma, perhaps care in the direction, perhaps sheer speed--this incredible tale was made plausible. But nothing on earth, not even narration by Walter Cronkite, could perform that miracle here.\nNow, Rambo is not battling a mere town, a mere police force, a mere highway patrol. Now he is battling the combined Soviet and Vietnamese armies--and his own Washington superiors as well. And, from Stallone's glower when he asks Green Beret commander Richard Crenna, \"Are they gonna let us win this time?\" we see that only \"they\" could stop him. Hand this man a switchblade and he could carve off the U.S.S.R. with one stroke and hurl it into space.\nThat's the problem with the movie. If a character can seemingly do anything, it's hard to feel tension or concern about his fate. (At least, Superman had kryptonite.) We are left with nothing but detached aesthetic appreciation: watching Rambo race through several million dollars worth of explosions and aerial attacks, coruscant fireballs billowing everywhere and bodies flying hither and yon. Except for anyone irretrievably into violent power fantasies, this will probably soon pall.\nThere's more than an addled premise (Rambo alone rescuing America's MIAs). There's the sort of love interest you thought vanished with Debra Paget's old Indian robes: the alleged Vietnamese guide Co Bao (Julia Nickson), who wears mascara and guerrilla pantaloons, has light eyes and speaks dialogue of the \"we go now, forget me never\" variety.\nOne cannot call the film unprofessional. The cast is good, Jack Cardiff photographs Acapulco (disguised as Indochina) stunningly, Mark Goldblatt and Mark Helfrich edit with machine-gun crispness and a dozen stunt men and pilots continually raise the hair on your head. Director George Cosmatos (\"The Cassandra Crossing\") marshals these forces with the gusto of a Westmoreland, the warmth of a Patton, the wit of a Zhukov.\nBut \"Rambo\" is a movie with absolutely no inner life. It's a series of exhortations punctuated by bomb bursts. (The screenplay, co-written by Stallone and \"The Terminator's\" James Cameron, oddly combines Cameron's zingy paranoia with Stallone's muscle-flexing optimism.) At the end, when Rambo, asked what he wants out of life, screams hoarsely that America must recognize and accept Vietnam vets, it seems less a logical response from a fatigued (and mud-spattered) hero than Stallone yelling his guts out to audiences everywhere.\nWouldn't it be nobler testimonial to the men who suffered in Vietnam to recognize their non-combatant contributions and to help them in battling scourges like indifference and Agent Orange-related diseases, rather than dream up multimillion-dollar fantasies about winning a war that ended more than a decade ago?\n'RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II' A Tri-Star release.

{"prompt": "The cryptocurrency craze is reaching frenzied levels as 2017 draws to a close.\nBarely in the cents when trading was started at the beginning of this decade, the price of the signature currency - bitcoin - has jumped some twentyfold this year from nearly US$ 1,000 to surge past the US$20,000 mark.\nWhile monetary authorities in various parts of the world are sounding the alarm about the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies, there is a lesser-known danger posed by these \"cryptos\" (as they are sometimes known). Beneath the veneer of a fast buck, little attention is paid to the exact magnitude of energy that is required round the clock to churn out such currencies.\nA crypto is generated in cyberspace where so-called \"miners\" verify and link transactions to blocks and solve what is called \"proof-of-work\" problems. These are complicated mathematical problems that get increasingly harder to solve. Miners thus have to demonstrate the work done to find a \"hash\" that is acceptable and this is shown through the", "baseline": "amount of processing power used. In other words, the value of a crypto comes from the computations done.\nTherein lies the problem. Computer processing in itself is energy intensive. To create cryptos, much electricity is needed to run the processors. In addition, these emit much heat when in operation. Huge fans are needed to cool the systems so that they do not break down, and this causes even more energy to be used.\nThe ongoing race is for the miners to have the fastest processors to solve problems of escalating difficulty. In the beginning, consumer-grade systems such as graphics processing units could be used to generate cryptos. But this is not possible now and professional miners currently deploy high-end application-specific integrated circuit chips which are solely dedicated for crypto-mining.\nThe race for cryptos has reached a stage where a whole new industry of cryptocurrency mining is being spawned.\nChina alone accounts for 58 per cent of the bitcoin mines. But the \"dirty secret\" is that many of these mines run on electricity from coal, which is a most environmentally unfriendly source of energy (in total, China gets 60 per cent of its electricity from coal). As an illustration, there is a mine in Inner Mongolia, a province of China, which has eight metal warehouses, each 100m long, with a total of 25,000 computers just to mine bitcoins. Interestingly, there are also clusters of mines in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan that tap the on-site sources of hydroelectricity.\nOther countries are chasing the crypto trophy too. It is reported that the Russians are seriously keen on dominating crypto mining. We are facing a stage where massive amounts of energy will be consumed for the creation of cryptos. This goes beyond the bitcoin itself. In fact, there are now more than 1,300 types of cryptos and the number is increasing rapidly given the ongoing rage of ICOs - initial coin offerings.\nSo how much energy is actually utilised in the production of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoins? As a quick gauge, a single bitcoin transaction has been reported to use the same amount of energy to power nine homes in the United States for one day.\nThe total computing power amassed by the bitcoin network is some 100,000 times larger than the world's 500 fastest supercomputers put together.\nIn terms of energy amount, the bitcoin hardware taps some 31 terawatt-hours per year (1 terawatt is 1 trillion watts or 1 million million watts). This amount is greater than the energy usage of 150 countries or three-quarters of all countries in the world.\nThe even worse news is that the energy consumption of bitcoins is rising at an increasing rate per day. As of now, this rate is estimated to be 450 gigawatts per day (1 gigawatt is 1 billion watts).\nAs a related worry, there are even cases where cyber criminals are using \"botnets\" to exploit the processing power of their victims' computers through hidden software embedded in popular websites. There are probably about 220 such websites that carry these software with a global reach of some 500 million users. In other words, half a billion people may be unwittingly mining cryptos for other people who exploit free computing power for their illegitimate benefits.\nBut the greatest worry is what will happen if cryptos' ravenous appetite for power continues unchecked. According to one projection by Digiconomist, a cryptocurrency publication, more energy will be exhausted by bitcoins than the whole of the US by July 2019, and the entire world's energy consumption will be surpassed by the end of 2020.\nLet's compare crypto transactions with those of traditional credit cards. Digiconomist estimated that the present Visa payment system uses the energy equivalent of 50,000 US households to run 350 million transactions, while bitcoin uses the energy equivalent of 2.8 million US households to run 350,000 transactions. In other words, bitcoin transactions are 56,000 times more energy hungry than Visa's.\nSo the whole crypto craze is not just about the rise and rise of prices. It is also about the fallout from crypto mining's massive and ever-increasing demand for energy. While some analysts disagree with Digiconomist's projection, there is no dispute over crypto mining's very serious - and rising - drain on energy resources.\nWith all the rhetoric and efforts expended to mitigate global warming and climate change, it seems quite out of place that we forget about the elephant in the room, namely bitcoin. While the miners and speculators are laughing all the way to the bank, the rest of us are paying the price for their free-riding on the environment.\nthe bitcoin hardware taps some 31 terawatt-hours per year. This amount is greater than the energy usage of 150 countries or three-quarters of all countries in the world.\nNaturally, regulation is the solution for any problem that has an externality where costs are borne by others. This is indeed the case for pollution, as we see in carbon taxes or carbon trading schemes.\nBut cryptos are difficult to regulate as it is difficult to ring-fence the transactions. Tax, in particular, is not feasible. Buyers and sellers will find any jurisdiction that offers the best deal and, in cyberspace, locating such havens is not difficult.\nA new global financial order is probably necessary for effective monitoring of crypto advancements before the planet experiences a burnout. That's probably a tall order given the transboundary nature of the problem, not to mention its virtual dimension.\nGovernments around the world can try to band together and outlaw cryptos altogether but that may not be possible given the inherent nature of the underlying technology. Indeed, cryptos riding on the so-called blockchain approach may have reached the point of no return.\nCryptos are here to stay. The damage their creation is likely to inflict on energy and environmental sustainability is real. We cannot stand by and watch while crypto-scrapers dig for profits at our expense. While they have their blockchains, we lose our food chains.\nAs individual consumers, we can probably do our bit to protect the world. So, before we buy that bitcoin, think again. \u2022The writer is director of the Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations at NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.

End users with an active service came in 27 percent higher at 266,984.\nWhen questioned on the discrepancy in the amount of serviceable premises compared to those taking up the service - especially given NBN Co\u2019s goal of 70 percent penetration for the 8 million premises to be connected by 2020 - Morrow said the penetration rate within the 15 FSAMs to be switched off copper indicated the \u201csigns were positive\u201d that the company would reach that goal.\nHe also revealed NBN Co had integrated all its 121 points of interconnect, and expected the remainder of the transit network - which will link all the POIs with 54,000 kilometres of fibre - to be completed this year.\nMorrow also trumpeted the company\u2019s FTTN trial in the NSW suburb of Umina, claiming previously announced average peak download and upload speeds of 90Mbps and 36Mbps respectively.\nHowever, NBN Co chief customer officer John Simon revealed those premises were located close to the node - between 300 and 500 metres away - and the speeds fell to around 50Mbps when the premise was located between 700 and 800 metres out.\nHe stressed it was an \u201cearly trial\u201d on a limited number of customers, and NBN Co would be able to achieve a more accurate statistical sample when it commercialises the nodes later next year.\n\u201cObviously as you go further away, the line rate on the copper drops,\u201d Simon said.\nChief operating officer Greg Adcock emphasised that only four of the customers involved in the trial were receiving speeds under 50 Mbps.\n\u201cThis is a trial and we are learning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe do have an obligation set by the Government that 90 percent of the fixed-line footprint will be at 50Mbps and no-one will be less than 25Mbps,\u201d CEO Morrow said.\nNBN Co reported capital expenditure of $677 million for the period - with a total of $6.3 million so far in the project - and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $252 million.\nOperating expenses came in at $281 million, while the company received $997 million worth of Government funding, bringing its total of the allocated $29.5 billion so far to $9.4 billion.\nAverage revenue per use grew four percent to $39."}

The North American market will hit the No. 2 spot with $1.5 billion, while Asia ($1.1 billion) and the rest of the world ($0.6 billion) will follow.\nPut together, the VR industry will generate $5.1 billion in 2016, according to SuperData's report.\nThat's up from $660 million in 2015, when headsets were only available to developers.

It is the more mature demographics that have the disposable income, with 18-54-year-olds saying they're willing to spend around $280 for hardware. Likewise, emerging markets like China are volume-reliant since average user revenue is low. Platform holders will initially heavily subsidize their hardware to build up significant market share.\"\nThe report also sheds some light on gamer interest by genre. Action leads the way, followed by Action-Adventure, Adventure, FPS, and RPG.

{"prompt": "As the car that practically spearheaded Toyota\u2019s rise as the country\u2019s best-selling automotive brand, the Toyota Vios needs little introduction. It\u2019s the modern day \u2018people\u2019s car,\u2019 attracting car shoppers with its affordability, easy maintenance, and of course, its Toyota badge. There was just one problem: its NZ engine, now more than a decade old, was starting to show its age. In terms of fuel economy, it wasn\u2019t keeping up with the competition, and consumers were starting to notice. Toyota isn\u2019t the country\u2019s top automotive marque for nothing, however, and they\u2019ve been keenly listening in to their costumers\u2019 wants and needs. Their response comes in the form of the Vios\u2019 new powertrain \u2014 Toyota\u2019s Dual VVT-I 1NR-FE engine paired with a CVT transmission. Let\u2019s take a deeper look to see what else has changed.\nThe Toyota Vios hasn\u2019t changed its looks much since 2013, and that\u2019s a testament to how well the design holds up over time. Its", "baseline": "well-proportioned silhouette is complemented by a large grille, flanked by two chrome-plated foglamp housings. At the rear, the trunk\u2019s chrome strip extends its design across the rear tail lights. It\u2019s a nice touch and shows some attention to detail which you don\u2019t normally see in entry level vehicles. A small spoiler highlights the rear, giving the Vios a touch of sporty attitude. It\u2019s an easy design to play around with, though its looks would be much improved with wheels larger than the 15-inch alloys it comes with.\nIf you\u2019ve got a keen eye, you\u2019ll notice some slight changes with the interior. There are new silver highlights on the AVT touchscreen and shift knob, and brushed aluminum details on the dash and door panels. The soft-touch plastics and leather stitched-style treatment on the dash enhance the premium level of the cabin, to the point where you\u2019ll almost forget you\u2019re in a B-segment vehicle. Typical of Toyota, the interior build quality is remarkable to a car in this price category. Buttons and knobs feel solid to the touch, and the instrument cluster is clear and highly legible. There\u2019s also ample space at the rear for three medium-sized adults, while two large adults will have nothing to complain about. The Vios\u2019 steering wheel still doesn\u2019t support telescopic adjustments, but getting into a comfortable driving position wasn\u2019t a problem at all.\nOn paper, Toyota\u2019s new NR engine seems like a step down from the old NZ power plant. At 108hp and 140Nm of torque, the new engine has slightly less torque than its predecessor. Whatever the specs are on paper, it\u2019s a different story in the driver\u2019s seat. The engine response is noticeably quicker at low speeds compared to the previous model. Where you once had to get the revs going to gain speed, acceleration happens at a more linear pace, and the Vios feels perfectly at home cruising at speeds of 100 km/h without any drama.\nThe CVT transmission does take a bit of driving excitement away, but is a sensible addition to the Vios, given its practical nature. The end goal is, after all, improved fuel economy. So how does it do? Thanks to the Dual VVT-I engine (which adjusts timings on both intake and exhaust camshafts) and CVT transmission, the Toyota Vios achieves an average of 10 kilometers per liter on mixed city and highway driving conditions. On pure highway conditions, 15 kilometers per liter is easily attainable. Goal achieved? We certainly think so.\nMany have tried to take a slice of the B-segment pie away from the Vios, but Toyota now has all the bases covered and locked down. The Vios offers driver and passenger airbags, complete connectivity to Bluetooth and MirrorLink devices, as well as six speakers, which is a lot of value for a sub-P1M car. With improved fuel efficiency, trustworthy Toyota reliability, and a P902,000 price tag, practicality simply doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\nThe Philippines sells 300,000 brand new vehicles a year without retiring the same number of older cars. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we have traffic gridlock.\n1.3 engine at 10km per liter?\nPrado is 2.7 and consume the same.\nThis is what old engine is ma konsumo."}
{"prompt": "Stephen Leone & Daniel Neumark, Attosecond Physics Laboratory, UC Berkeley.\nhe entire semiconductor industry, not to mention Silicon Valley, is built on the propensity of electrons in silicon to get kicked out of their atomic shells and become free. These mobile electrons are routed and switched though transistors, carrying the digital information that characterizes our age. An international team of physicists and chemists based at the University of California, Berkeley, has for the first time taken snapshots of this ephemeral event using attosecond pulses of soft x-ray light lasting only a few billionths of a billionth of a second.\nWhile earlier femtosecond lasers were unable to resolve the jump from the valence shell of the silicon atom across the band-gap into the conduction electron region, the new experiments now show that this transition takes less than 450 attoseconds.\n\"Though this excitation step is too fast for traditional experiments, our novel technique allowed us to record individual snapshots that can be composed into a 'movie' revealing the timing sequence of the process,\" explains Stephen Le", "baseline": "one, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and physics.\nLeone, his UC Berkeley colleagues and collaborators from the Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t in Munich, Germany, the University of Tsukuba, Japan, and the Molecular Foundry at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report their achievement in the Dec. 12 issue of the journal Science.\nLeone notes that more than a century has elapsed since the discovery that light can make certain materials conductive. The first movie of this transition follows the excitation of electrons across the band-gap in silicon with the help of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy, developed in the Attosecond Physics Laboratory run by Leone and Daniel Neumark, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry.\nIn semiconducting materials, electrons are initially localized around the individual atoms forming the crystal and thus cannot move or contribute to electrical currents. When light hits these materials or a voltage is applied, some of the electrons absorb energy and get excited into mobile states in which the electrons can move through the material. The localized electrons take a \"quantum jump\" into the conduction band, tunneling through the barrier that normally keeps them bound to atoms.\nThese mobile electrons make the semiconductor material conductive so that an applied voltage results in a flowing current. This behavior allows engineers to make silicon switches, known as transistors, which have become the basis of all digital electronics.\nThe researchers used attosecond XUV spectroscopy like an attosecond stop watch to follow the electron's transition. They exposed a silicon crystal to ultrashort flashes of visible light emitted by a laser source. The subsequent illumination with x-ray-pulses of only a few tens of attoseconds (10-18 seconds) in duration allowed the researchers to take snapshots of the evolution of the excitation process triggered by the laser pulses.\nUnambiguous interpretation of the experimental data was facilitated by a series of supercomputer simulations carried out by researchers at the University of Tsukuba and the Molecular Foundry. The simulations modeled both the excitation process and the subsequent interaction of x-ray pulses with the silicon crystal.\nThe excitation of a semiconductor with light is traditionally conceived as a process involving two distinct events. First, the electrons absorb light and get excited. Afterwards, the lattice, composed of the individual atoms in the crystal, rearranges in response to this redistribution of electrons, turning part of the absorbed energy into heat carried by vibrational waves called phonons.\nIn analyzing their data, the team found clear indications that this hypothesis is true. They showed that initially, only the electrons react to the impinging light while the atomic lattice remains unaffected. Long after the excitation laser pulse has left the sample -- some 60 femtoseconds later -- they observed the onset of a collective movement of the atoms, that is, phonons. This is near the 64 femtosecond period of the fastest lattice vibrations.\nBased on current theory, the researchers calculated that the lattice spacing rebounded about 6 picometers (10-12 meters) as a result of the electron jump, consistent with other estimates.\n\"These results represent a clean example of attosecond science applied to a complex and fundamentally important system,\" Neumark says.\nThe unprecedented temporal resolution of this attosecond technology will allow scientists to resolve extremely brief electronic processes in solids that to date seemed too fast to be approached experimentally, says Martin Schultze, who was a guest researcher in Leone's lab last year, visiting from the Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen. This poses new challenges to the theory of light-matter interactions, including the excitation step, its timescale and the interpretation of experimental x-ray spectra.\n\"But here is also an advantage,\" Schultze adds. \"With our ultrashort excitation and probing pulses, the atoms in the crystal can be considered frozen during the interaction. That eases the theoretical treatment a lot.\""}

{"prompt": "There are the rivalries that infect the heart, never to be repeated. If you loved the Brooklyn Dodgers then you hated the Giants. And here, if you cheer for Magallanes, then you despise Caracas.\nEdgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' rising star, is the third baseman for Magallanes, the team situated in this city, and for years, his older brother Edgar played for Caracas -- the big brother of all cities in Venezuela, the capital, a two-hour drive east of here. The Alfonzos competed ferociously in the winter league, feeding the feud.\nIn that crucible, Edgardo Alfonzo developed the skills that have turned him into a budding star in New York, the major market in the major leagues. He hit .315 last season, ranked second in the National League with a .417 batting average with runners in scoring position, and finished second in Gold Glove Award voting, behind San Diego's Ken Caminiti. Eligible for salary arbitration this winter, he is in a position to make a great deal of money. In large measure", "baseline": ", he has Edgar and the rivalry with his brother to thank for that.\nIn one game between Magallanes and Caracas, Edgardo charged a slow grounder hit by his brother, fielded it near the mound and threw spectacularly to first for the out, glancing pointedly at Edgar afterward.\nAn inning or two later, Edgardo slammed a line drive destined for the left-field corner, until speared by Edgar Alfonzo, the Caracas diving third baseman.\nHaving restored order, Edgar grinned, and Caracas fans excitedly waved their flags and blew into noisemakers. They understood the feud: Caracas vs. Magallanes, Edgar vs. Edgardo. But they could not see all the layers in the dense relationship between rival siblings.\n''It's something that's hard to put into words,'' said Edgardo, the youngest of four Alfonzo children, sitting last week in Villa Madrid, a restaurant here.\nEdgar, the first-born, came along in 1967, the year after his parents met and married, in a case of love at first sight. Edgar Alfonzo Sr. was on a job when he met Mercedes Pino, and in spite of the objections of her mother, they married within four months. Edgar Sr. drove a truck for a medical supplier, keeping him away from home in the small town of Miranda (population: 1,000) until late at night, or a week or two at a time.\nHe casually followed the careers of the best Venezuelan baseball players, such as Luis Aparicio and Vic Davalillo, but he did not play the game. Rather, he played jacks, gambling for money as a teen-ager. Baseball, he thought, was something only tots should play, certainly not a prospective vocation.\nFor growing boys, baseball was a waste of valuable time, he thought, a lure away from school and the education that could prove pivotal in their lives. The children of Edgar and Mercedes would concentrate on their school and go to a university; he would see to that.\nBut Edgar Jr. could not forget about baseball, and when his father's job took him out of Miranda, the boy would sneak off to play. Mercedes Alfonzo knew what her oldest son was doing, but never told her husband. When Edgar Sr. returned from work, Edgar could only sit home and wince over the thought of his friends playing nearby.\nBut the periods of inactivity hardly dulled his skills. By the time he was 14, Edgar was playing baseball with young adults, 20 or 21 years old, and one afternoon, before an important game, a handful of them went to the Alfonzo house to speak with Edgar Sr. Your son is a very good player, one of them told the father, and you should come watch him play today.\nEdgar Sr. agreed, and the boy, distracted by the presence of his father and feeling as if this was a one-day audition, struck out three times. He returned home crestfallen, certain that his father would be furious.\n''I know you were nervous because I was there,'' Edgar Sr. told his son, and they made a deal: Edgar Jr. had one year to prove himself. If he could not, he would quit baseball for good and then concentrate on school. Attending a game shortly thereafter, Edgar Sr. found himself being pestered by a friend convinced of Edgar's greatness. His friend bet Edgar Sr. that the boy would hit a home run that day, and when Edgar did so, his father lost a six pack of beer. Happily.\nWithin three years, Edgar Jr. signed a contract to play for Caracas. The first time the skinny teen-ager appeared on television in Miranda, Edgardo could hear his neighbors yelling in their houses, shouting, laughing. Asked last week about the moment, their father paused, his eyes watering. ''My first son,'' he said in Spanish, before looking down.\nPride surged through Edgardo, then 11 years old, tempered by concern for his brother's success. ''I was hoping nobody would hit a ball to him,'' Edgardo recalled.\nTo Edgardo, who was still playing in the sandlots, his older brother was a hero, someone to emulate. They had always been close. On those rare moments they bickered, their father would admonish them. You must not fight, Edgar Sr. would say. You are brothers.\nEdgar signed with the California Angels when he was 17, and his departure for the United States was traumatic, with all the Alfonzos gathered at the airport in Caracas. He called home three times his first day away, homesick, but, his father recalled, he sounded both sad and excited. Edgar was pursuing his dream.\nHe would return to Miranda every fall, sharing his used equipment and experience with his two brothers. Even when Edgardo was little, Edgar was sure his little brother would be a great player. He remembers watching Edgardo play a Little League game when he was 11. Twice Edgardo stopped grounders with a dive and rose to make wicked throws, and the line drives off his bat generated a peculiar sound.\nEdgar gradually climbed through the minors, establishing himself as a useful utility player. But his batting average fluctuated, injuries hampered him, and he did not have the speed to steal bases or the power to hit home runs consistently. In 1990, he had 2 hits in 11 at-bats for Class AAA Edmonton, and thereafter, his career bogged down in the minor leagues.\nHis kid brother, Edgardo, playing shortstop and second base, turned 17 in 1990, and thought about signing with Caracas. Edgar, then 23, encouraged him to consider all his options. Another team would have more opportunity; Caracas had a logjam of older players. Edgardo signed to play with Magallanes in Venezuela, and with the Mets in the United States. Edgar bragged to his manager with Caracas, Phil Regan, that Edgardo would be a terrific player.\nThat summer, Tamargo said, it became apparent Edgardo would be a good major league player or better.\nThat summer, Edgar realized that his career might stall in the minor leagues or worse. He was playing for Class AA Bowie, in the Baltimore organization, in the same league as his brother. The first time Bowie played at Binghamton, Edgar went to Edgardo's small, shared apartment for dinner.\nEdgar Alfonzo, now 30, lives with his wife and children in Texas, and departed Monday to play in Taiwan. After three major league seasons, Edgardo Alfonzo, now 24, is a celebrity in Venezuela, his stature approaching that of Andres Galarraga of the Atlanta Braves. The first time Alfonzo played for Magallanes this season, fans at Jose Bernardo Perez Stadium stood and cheered. At the Villa Madrid, patrons and waiters occasionally interrupt him as he discusses Edgar."}

The fourth new face to start was defender Dan Webster, formerly of Burgess Hill Town and signed from Horsham YMCA.\nThe Robins' most eye catching signing of the summer wasn't present here. Phil Johnson has also returned from YM after three goal-studded seasons at Gorings M", "baseline": "ead since he left Hassocks in the summer of 2015.\nJohnson was ruled out of this one through injury but the acquisition of him and Benson, both of whom featured in the Premier Division's golden boot chart last season, should help ensure that Hassocks manage more than the 38 goals they scored last time out which left them as the second lowest scorers in the division.\nIt was Heath who started the better of the two sides with Stuart Chester's pace and crossing ability and Fender's presence giving Harris and his back four of Harry Mills, Webster, Jordan Badger and Bradley Bant plenty to think about.\nFender had the first clear cut chance of the game when a lovely through ball from Lee Carney put him clear but he dragged his shot just wide of the post.\nAfter weathering the storm, Spencer Slaughter and Matt Berridge began to give Hassocks some control in midfield and the impressive Jake Lindsey drew a save from Heath's new goalkeeper Mark Fox with a long range effort.\nSpinks then found Benson with a visionary pass and Benson showed good strength to barge one-time Hassocks defender Glen Woodburn off the ball to leave himself one-on-one with Fox. Remarkably, referee Robert King awarded a free kick to Heath, much to the annoyance of everyone in red.\nThe last chance of the first half came when Hassocks failed to clear a corner with the ball eventually falling just outside the area to Marlon Maxwell but his brilliant connection was only rewarded with the shot flying just over the bar.\nNeither side seemed to have played to their potential in the first half with the main talking point being not about any of the new signings on the pitch, but the addition of Dark Fruits cider to the bar which went down a treat with supporters.\nHassocks were quickest out the blocks in the second half with Wilkins causing trouble down the right flank, his pull back finding Spinks who drew another comfortable save from Fox.\nHeath then had the best chance of the game, Ben Hands delivering a superb cross right onto the head of Fender but his powerful head was wonderfully kept out by the reflexes of Harris.\nThat save seemed to galvanise the Robins and Benson and the outstanding Berridge both went close to beat Fox before Spinks put the ball into the penalty area and just as Wilkins was about to pull the trigger, he was clumsily bundled over by Woodburn.\nMr King pointed straight to the spot and Benson made no mistake with the spot kick, beating Fox with ease to give the Robins the lead.\nIt was all Hassocks after that with Benson the centre of attention. He breezed his way into the box but instead of shooting, opted for the unselfish pass to Wilkins who was slightly off balance and as a result couldn't hit the target.\nHeath equalised shortly after with a real sucker punch. Scott Weller delivered a defence splitting pass to Fender who used his strength and pace to blast through and smash home an equaliser for 1-1.\nHassocks made a double change in response as Dan Stokes and Harvey Blake, the fifth new face on the day having signed from Mid Sussex Premier Division side Sporting Lindfield, took to the field.\nBlake had a lively cameo in his first 10 minutes in senior football. He was denied a debut goal by an excellent save from Fox after Wilkins had broken down the wing to cross and Blake then turned provider with a marauding run down the flank from which he found Benson but the Hassocks striker couldn't get the sort of connection he was looking for and it resulted in a comfortable save for Fox.\nThat was the final chance of the game with a draw just about the right result. There were certainly plenty of positives to take for the Robins ahead of a stern test against one of the title favourites, Chichester City on Tuesday night.\nHassocks: Alex Harris; Harry Mills, Jordan Badger, Dan Wesbter, Bradley Bant; Jack Wilkins, Spencer Slaughter, Matt Berridge, Jake Lindsey; Alex Spinks; Liam Benson.\nSubs: Dan Stokes, Harvey Blake (used)."}

Founded by Achille Maramotti in Italy in 1951, Max Mara\u2019s aim was to blend high-end cuts and style with industrial tailoring techniques. In an era when most clothes were still handmade, this shift in approach was a game changer, \u00adoffering garments that were still beautifully designed, but available at a far more affordable price.\nAlmost uniquely, the brand spoke to working women, creating smart, \u00adhighly wearable solutions. The reaction was spectacular, with ladies flocking to snap up its creations. One piece in particular became an instant classic: the 101801 camel coat in supple wool and cashmere, which is still a bestseller. Coupling a quiet, \u00adunder-the-radar aesthetic with smart yet practical dressing meant that by the time of his death in 2005, Achille Maramotti was the head of a company worth an estimated $1.2 billion. Today, the company is still owned and run by the Maramotti clan, with Achille\u2019s granddaughter MariaGiulia representing the third generation of the family.\nThe brand\u2019s partnership with WIF comes in the form of financial sponsorship, and led to the creation of the Max Mara Face of the Future Award, which every year selects one emerging actress deserving of special recognition. Past recipients including Kate Mara, Hailee Steinfeld, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Banks, Ginnifer Goodwin and Emily Blunt, showing that Max Mara is not only ahead of the game in terms of promoting equality, but has a pretty good eye for talent, too.\nWhen not doling out accolades to up-and-coming talents, Max Mara runs a serious business trying to anticipate and cater to the needs of an ever-\u00adevolving audience. Its ability to weather the vagaries of consumer demand can perhaps be attributed to the brand\u2019s internal stability, both in terms of the consistency of still being owned by the same family, and of having the same designer at its helm for 30 years. The British-born creative Ian Griffiths has fashioned collections for Max Mara for more than three decades, and yet far from being a household name, most people have never heard of him.\n\u201cThe idea of a designer like Ian Griffiths being with the company for three decades means that he has grown with it, and there has been an intertwining between his vision and the one of the brand, which was obviously not revolutionary, yet evolved organically.\nFar from being staid and predictable, however, Griffiths has been \u2013 quietly \u2013 challenging boundaries. Max Mara was one of the first big-name brands to put the hijab-wearing Halima Aden on the runway in 2017, kick-starting not only her career, but forcing other designers to start thinking about diversity. Following in the footsteps of founder Achille, Griffiths has worked hard behind the scenes to ensure that the label keeps apace with the lives of modern women."}

{"prompt": "It's a talented field and too close to call, but we're going to try.\nTo prepare for the 2019 Juno Awards, we're breaking down each of the four classical categories.\nHaving already analyzed the large ensemble category, we now turn our attention to classical album of the year: solo or chamber.\nNote how this category is a showdown this year between Analekta Records (three nominations) and Hyperion Records (two nominations). Whereas a number of the albums nominated in the large ensemble category are live recordings, all five nominees in the solo/chamber category are studio recordings, and the sound quality is consistently high. Two of the nominees are first-timers (Wan and Pouliot), Richard-Hamelin is enjoying his second nomination, while Gryphon Trio, Hamelin and Hewitt are Juno veterans with 11, 16 and 17 nominations, respectively.\nIt's a deserving bunch. Who's missing?\nIf there were room for a couple more nominees, we'd have liked to see Eyb", "baseline": "ler Quartet's Beethoven String Quartets, Op. 18, Nos. 1-3 on the list. With their adherence to Beethoven's controversial original metronome marks, the members of Eybler Quartet got us to hear those familiar pieces in a new way, which is always exciting. Another great listen was Lachrimae, a collection of music by John Dowland played by Nigel North (lute) and Les Voix humaines (viol consort). We surrendered ourselves to the undulating phrases of these pavanes and galliards, so seductively played.\nAlas, there's only room for five. Here's our breakdown of this year's nominees, including predictions for who should win and who will win.\nThis September 2018 release marked the culmination of phase 1 of Wan and Richard-Hamelin's project to perform and record the complete cycle of Beethoven's 10 sonatas for violin and piano. Their partners in the endeavour are the Arte Musica Foundation, which presents the duo in concert at Montreal's Bourgie Hall, and Analekta Records, which holds recording sessions and produces the albums. It's a winning formula, as Vol. 1 of the series attests.\nHere, they play the three sonatas Beethoven published in 1803 as his Op. 30, works poised on the cusp: No. 6 is the most classical of the three; No. 7 the most Romantic; No. 8 falls stylistically somewhere in the middle.\nRichard-Hamelin applies a firm tone to the ominous piano opening of the seventh sonata, to which Wan replies with bite and assertive melodic leaps. Then, a translucent violin timbre draws you into the second movement's intimate t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\nIn Sonata No. 8, both musicians have fun with the frenzy of the first movement's churning compound meter before taking turns with the gracious melody of the second movement. A rustic dance, the third movement finds Richard-Hamelin setting the pace hurdy-gurdy-style while Wan fiddles away with abandon. It's a romp.\nBy contrast, the sixth sonata, which opens the album, is perfectly genteel. There's uncanny consensus on the phrasing in the outer movements, while the Adagio is the album's highlight with Wan providing nuanced colours and Richard-Hamelin transforming his piano part into a languorous Nocturne.\nWan and Richard-Hamelin form a winning duo. But will they win the Juno?\nWhile her global Bach Odyssey is ongoing, Hewitt has also been toiling away on two other projects for Hyperion Records: she's eight albums into the complete Beethoven piano sonatas, and she has released a second volume in her exploration of the keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, the latter of which got this Juno nod.\nFor this album, Hewitt was drawn to the sonatas with surprising elements, which she evidently enjoys accentuating. For instance, she leans deliciously on the bass line of K206, the longest piece on the album, to underscore an unusual shift from E major to E-flat minor. In K429, the absence of any melody to speak of does not deter her from making beautiful sense of this barcarolle, with its suspenseful pauses and descending runs. In K82, she treats us to one of the few Scarlatti sonatas that's written in fugal form. Of course, Hewitt knows fugues and she executes this one's 3/8 meter with characteristic clarity and elegance.\nAre the tempos a bit cautious? Maybe, although as audiences we've come to expect breakneck speed in Scarlatti's sonatas, which doesn't necessarily cast them in the best light. The ones Hewitt has chosen for this album reveal how wide-ranging these pieces are, in fact.\nHewitt has been nominated in this category six times since her last win in 2005. Will this album turn the tide?\nThis goes down as one of the best debut albums we've heard in a long time, and it was just one accomplishment among many for Pouliot in 2018: he won the Women's Musical Club of Toronto's 2018 Career Development Award and the Virginia Parker Prize, and his loan of the Canada Council's 1729 Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin, valued at $6 million, was renewed for another three-year term.\nIt's on that instrument that he recorded these works by Ravel and Debussy, alongside his associate from the Colburn School in Los Angeles, pianist Hsin-I Huang. Pouliot's effusive personality is well-suited to Ravel's Tzigane, which he plays with raffish slides and perfectly tuned double stops. He and Huang make Ravel's familiar G Major Sonata sound brand new, with technical brilliance and astute characterizations throughout.\nSome violinists employ an austere tone for Debussy's moody Violin Sonata, his last completed work. Not Pouliot, whose rich, vibrant timbre brings greater intensity to its first movement and accentuates the impish nature of the second. He and Huang use the episodic structure of the third movement to tell a story so vivid it stays with you long after the music has ended.\nPouliot is on a roll. Will it continue with his first Juno Award?\nReleased in January 2018 to celebrate Gryphon Trio's 25th anniversary, this album pairs two works composed approximately 100 years ago: Maurice Ravel's famous Piano Trio in A Minor from 1914 and Clarke's Piano Trio, written in 1921. The album's title, The End of Flowers, refers to the devastation caused by World War I. \"Completed within the early frenzy and aftermath of this bleak chapter in human history, these brilliant works were not intended as memorials but stand as a testament to the enduring power of life and art,\" writes Gryphon Trio cellist Roman Borys in the album's notes.\nThe album begins with Clarke's trio, the heavier of the two. Pianist Jamie Parker establishes a violent mood with the dissonant machine-gun theme that opens the work and ties its three movements together. Lyrical passages come as a relief \u2014 for instance, in the second movement, when the strings shift to harmonics for a delicate accompanying motif while the piano introduces a simple melody, it's like a ray of light. The musicians do a fine job expressing the third movement's conflicting ideas of optimism and regret, the latter intruding in the form of a mournful bugle call.\nIn Ravel's ingenious trio, the musicians display the full range of their artistry. Props to violinist Annalee Patipatanakoon for her heartfelt restraint while introducing the lovely second theme of the first movement. There are shades of La Valse in their performance of the sprightly second movement, and warmly spun lines in the Passacaille. The final movement turns the three musicians loose in a rollicking sonata form in which they revel in electrifying tremolos, bombastic piano chords and the bouncy ride of an irregular meter. It's quite a climax!\nGryphon Trio's 25th anniversary was a party. Will the celebrations extend to a Juno win?\nCan you believe Hamelin made more than 75 albums for Hyperion Records without recording a note of music by Franz Schubert? It's a situation he amended in April with this highly anticipated record pairing Schubert's final piano sonata and his second set of Impromptus. \"I could have done it before,\" Hamelin told us when the album came out. \"It wasn't just a question of my developing a relationship with the work, it was also waiting until the trust of the public in what I do, in what I could do with it, would become greater and greater.\" It's safe to say he has earned that trust, and then some.\nHamelin, who's been playing the Sonata in B-flat Major in concert for decades, uses a remarkably restrained tempo for the opening movement, not only drawing attention to detail but also preparing the way for Schubert's varied treatment of the wistful main theme. Sensitive souls should proceed with caution in the second movement, whose A section Hamelin imbues with a feeling of inexorable regret \u2014 emotional stuff. A light touch and perfectly controlled dynamics make the third movement scherzo glow from within, and in the fourth movement, Hamelin unites the seemingly disparate ideas with intelligent timing and awesome technique.\nIn Schubert's Op. 142, which Hamelin says \"is probably as close to a sonata as it could be without actually being one,\" he invites us to hear the four Impromptus as a unified work, one without the tragic overtones of the final sonata. He plays down the sturm und drang of the first Impromptu in favour of a more tender interpretation. In the second Impromptu, we love the silky homogeneity of the chords and the lilting effect of his agogic treatment of the main theme. The variations of the third have all the charm of a strophic Lied, while Hamelin turns the scherzo and trio of the fourth into a demonic dance seemingly summoned from the pages of Goethe.\nFans seized this album when it was released. Will Hamelin seize a Juno trophy?\nWe got swept up in the excitement surrounding rising violin star Pouliot. His debut album is a joy to listen to and we think it deserves the Juno.\nThe Juno jury will be understandably wowed by Hamelin's Schubert statement, and the award will go to him."}

On his downtime, he blogs about management, entrepreneurship, and happiness on the iDoneThis blog.\nGetting rid of managers may seem like just another tech trend, but much of the skepticism around going \u201cbossless\u201d or flat is due to misleading terminology. We don\u2019t quite have a good vocabulary for it yet \u2014 no managers doesn\u2019t mean no management, and flat structure doesn\u2019t mean everyone has equal sway.\nPower, leadership, and even hierarchy still exist in these alternative structures, but instead of running along career ladders and hanging out in corner offices, they tend to be decentralized and dynamic rather than static and top-down.\nAt its heart, the move away from bosses is a reaction against command and control management. Bossy practices and overbearing pecking orders disconnect people from meaning and intrinsic motivation at work.\nTalented people don\u2019t go into startups to follow step-by-step directions and wait", "baseline": "for approval at every turn. They want to move fast, break things, discover, and create \u2014 not be treated like children.\nYour company doesn\u2019t have to get rid of managers or implement some formal system to adopt practices that will help your employees flourish. You do, however, have to build a foundation of trust and set up ways to guide and enable your employees to be collaborative, peer-managing leaders.\nMoving towards bosslessness, as with these three approaches, is a process of figuring out a better way for great employees to thrive and develop great companies.\nEssentially, I try to create little mini-managers, each responsible for managing a single person: themselves.\nAt first this is mainly about teaching people how to figure out what to work on right now (prioritization). Then it\u2019s more a matter of building their confidence both in themselves and their team to a point where they just do things they know is right without even talking to me (autonomy).\nRather than assigning and approving tasks at every turn, then, management is about keeping people in motion and getting out of their way.\nWhen you equip people with the knowledge they need to move forward, you don\u2019t have to keep telling them what to do. Freeing the flow of information from gatekeepers and bottlenecks increases agility and resourcefulness.\nFor the multibillion dollar games company, Supercell, that takes the form of daily morning emails with details from project progress and revenue figures to help orient not just some top circle but every employee. CEO Ilkka Paananen explains: \u201cIf you provide people with the key information, you don\u2019t need to tell people what to do, they can figure it out for themselves.\nBuzzfeed also makes work details transparent, inspired by a process started at Google called \u201cSnippets\u201d. Everyone sends in an email with what they get done and what they need help with to keep moving. Since people can subscribe to each other\u2019s updates, Snippets provides an at-a-glance view of what\u2019s happening in the company.\n[T]hat means that instead of everyone being the same, you embrace that everyone is different, and you look at the strength of connections between people, the communication channels, and how information travels amongst them.\nThese connections and channels are an important, often overlooked source of motivation, support, and information. Bosses don\u2019t always know best, but peers tend to be equipped with the most relevant knowledge to provide feedback and recognition. They know when someone is stepping up or slacking because they see and deal with it first-hand.\nOne study by Greg Stewart and Stephen Courtright even found that when peers in cohesive self-managing teams have some control over each other\u2019s rewards \u2014 such as raises, bonuses, and promotions, which traditionally exist as top-down edicts \u2014 both individual and team performance improve.\nShopify\u2019s internal tool Unicorn is one such peer-driven bonus system where employees can give public kudos for great work and support. This also furnishes managers with on-the-ground information about how to best help people succeed.\nShopify\u2019s bonus system won\u2019t work for every team or company. Managing people rather than tasks requires you to think about your particular culture and people to implement the best tools and processes.\nWhat works for one organization\u2019s culture may not for another, but the characteristics they share will be that people do great work together based on a sense of autonomy, trust, and shared accountability."}

{"prompt": "A car called the Excel is to go on sale in the United States for the first time Thursday morning. It is an unremarkable looking vehicle, resembling many of the small, efficient Japanese cars that have wrested a large share of the market from the domestic Big Three.\nThe Excel, though, is not from Japan. It is being imported from Korea, where its manufacturer, the Hyundai Corporation, is one of the nation's leading manufacturing groups. The Hyundai Excel is the first of what could be a torrent of small cars made in Korea and other Asian countries headed for American shores.\nThe 1970's saw the rise of the Japanese, aided by two gasoline supply scares that shifted consumer demand to small cars with high fuel economy. Last year imports, the vast majority of them Japanese, claimed 23.8 percent of the American car market.\nMany Korean-made cars will arrive here bearing familiar domestic labels, as the American auto companies join industries such as shoes, textiles and consumer electronics in shifting production to developing nations to take advantage of low-cost labor. According to the United Automobile Workers union, wages", "baseline": "and benefits for Korean auto workers average $2.16 an hour, compared with about $13 an hour in Japan and over $20 an hour in the United States.\nIn addition, Ford has an affiliate in Taiwan, Ford Lio Ho, that it says will produce a small car for sale in Canada within the next few years. The American Motors Corporation is assembling Jeep models with a Chinese partner in Peking, and A.M.C. officials are saying those vehicles may be shipped to the United States.\nHyundai clearly plans to use its labor cost advantage to help establish the brand name, pricing its bottom-of-the-line model at $4,995. But only 20 percent of its first-year sales will be of these stripped-down models. Most of the cars are expected to sell in the $5,500 to $6,500 range, still less than most comparably equipped Japanese or domestic models cost. And the increase in the value of the yen is putting upward pressure on Japanese car prices in this country.\nUnlike the Yugo, an even lower priced Yugoslavian-made car that made its debut in the American market in the fall, and has gotten some unfavorable reviews for its features and quality, the Hyundai Excel has been glowingly praised by the automotive press.\nHyundai sales will be limited by the capacity of its sole assembly plant to 100,000 shipments in the first year, but most auto analysts expect the cars to be sold as fast as they arrive. The new brand, which is not subject to any import restraints, was given an unintended boost by the Japanese Government, which extended restraints on exports by that country's car producers for another year.\nMost analysts and auto executives here expect the third world imports to eventually become an important factor in the American car market. Since demand is not expected to grow anywhere as quickly as supply, some existing producers are likely to lose market share, and possibly go out of business.\nHyundai officials say they have plans to bring in other, more expensive, car models into the American market if the Excel is successful.\nMichael Luckey, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said, ''They're talking about 5 percent of the market by 1990.'' Five percent of an 11 million car market would be 550,000 units, or about what the No. 2 importer, the Nissan Motor Company, sold last year. The Toyota Motor Corporation is No. 1.\nOne reason Hyundai has been able to beat its Korean competitors to the American market is its ties to the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan. Mitsubishi provided the technology for the Excel's front-wheel-drive engine and transmission. In return, Mitsubishi will sell 30,000 of the 100,000 Excels bound for America."}
{"prompt": "As India bans foreign surrogacy, clinics look towards Cambodia, but what will it mean for the rights of surrogates?\nNew Delhi, India - Rita* tucks hungrily into a plate of steaming white rice, daal (lentils), a mixed-vegetable curry, yoghurt and a green salad.\nHer just-washed hair is gathered at the nape of her neck in a loose bun and the bold, flower print of her tunic stretches out over her heavily pregnant belly. She sits cross-legged on the bed in her sunny room in the yellow surrogate house, just off the main road on the outskirts of Gurgaon, a hub of domestic and international businesses and sparkling malls and eateries bordering New Delhi.\nRita is one of the last surrogates in India carrying a child for a foreign couple. In October last year, when Rita was around five months pregnant, the Indian Council for Medical Research sent a notification (PDF) to all fertility clinics, ordering them \"not to entertain any foreigners for availing", "baseline": "surrogacy services in India\".\nEarlier, in a written affidavit to the Supreme Court, the Indian government had confirmed it \"does not support commercial surrogacy\" and that the new law will have provisions to \"prohibit and penalise commercial surrogacy services\".\nAn Asian Age report says that as the government finds it a \"contentious\" issue, addressing it \"is the need of the hour\".\nIndia has been criticised for its failure to regulate its surrogacy industry and seems determined to address surrogacy as a standalone issue: the much-discussed Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, drafted in 2007 by the then Congress government, of which surrogacy was a part, has now been been narrowed down to deal with just surrogacy and will be renamed the Surrogacy Regulation Bill.\nIt is at present being discussed by a group of ministers headed by union health minister J P Nadda.\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research directive followed the release of draft legislation by India's health ministry prohibiting foreigners - except those with family origins in India - from employing Indian surrogates.\nThe new law is in its final stages and is expected to be passed soon, outlawing foreign surrogacy with the aim of protecting the rights of surrogate mothers.\nFacing losses in what was a lucrative trade - India's surrogacy industry is estimated to be worth around $500m per year - Indian clinics have started moving out to Cambodia, a country with ambiguous surrogacy laws and a visa-on-arrival facility for Indian nationals. More than a dozen Thai and Indian clinics are already operating there.\n\"I am aware of a few Indian and Nepali clinics that have set up in Cambodia,\" says Sam Everingham, director of events and content for the Australia-based Families through Surrogacy. \"The surrogates come from Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. Some may also come from India - that's not clear yet.\"\nNon-Indian surrogates often charge anything from $15,000 upwards, and in the US, for example, where commercial surrogacy is allowed only in certain states, it can cost upwards of $150,000. In India, however, the costs are often well under $30,000.\n\"Prospective parents won't want to pay that amount, especially for a country where surrogacy laws are ambiguous,\" says Nepal-based Preeti Bista, cofounder of My Fertility Angel Cambodia.\nThese clinics will undoubtedly begin hiring Indian surrogates in Cambodia, Bista believes, simply because \"they are cheaper\".\nAnd some surrogates do not seem averse to this. Hundreds of them had protested against the ban outside the ICMR offices when the ruling was passed.\n\"I was struggling to pay off a debt of $8,000,\" Rita says. \"I left my home for nine months to stay in a new place. I am grateful I didn't have to travel, but I wouldn't mind if I had to.\"\nThat desperation isn't only shared by the surrogate mothers and their families. Surrogacy in India is also the last resort for many infertile couples in countries where surrogacy is either banned or prohibitively expensive.\n\"The difference between surrogacy costs in India and the US for most infertile couples is the difference between having the option to have a child or not,\" says New York-based hotelier Arnon Magal, who struggled with infertility for years and sought alternatives, including IVF treatments in Israel and Cyprus and two failed surrogacy pregnancies in India. He was hoping to again hire a surrogate in India this year.\nBut the ban comes after years of controversies that have plagued the industry, including accusations by rights groups of exploitation of surrogate mothers.\nBut Mark Henaghan, a New Zealand-based law professor, who follows the issue closely, believes that outlawing international surrogacy will only lead to more abuse of the surrogates.\n\"It is unlikely that the entire industry will cease now that it has been banned. It seems more likely that a black market or underground industry will spring up in its place, which will afford much less protection for everyone involved, especially the surrogates and the resulting children,\" says Henaghan.\nThis was the result when, in 2012, India banned single and gay-couple surrogacy. Neighbouring Nepal, which allowed surrogacy as long as the surrogate was not a Nepalese citizen, emerged as an offshore surrogacy hub with Indian clinics impregnating and then smuggling Indian surrogates across the border into Nepal for deliveries - a foreign country where the mothers' rights were not clearly defined.\nIt all came to a head in April last year when a massive earthquake hit Nepal and many Indian surrogates were stranded as Israel airlifted its own citizens and their babies, leaving the surrogates stranded in a quake-ravaged country. The country suspended commercial surrogacy the following August.\nBista was a coordinator for an international fertility agency that worked through an Indian clinic when the Nepal earthquake hit. She says they had to send surrogate mothers who were mid-term in their pregnancies back to India, while some others stayed behind in temporary shelters in Nepal to wait out their pregnancies.\n\"That was horrible,\" she says.\n\"Even before the earthquake, there were agencies in Nepal who kept surrogates in overcrowded surrogate houses with 10 or so in a room. Some of them had their children and husbands with them. There was no work for the husbands and it was a very harassing situation for them,\" she continues.\n\"I wouldn't deny it won't happen in Cambodia. The only way out is to regulate. When governments ban, people find other locations to continue. And in fact such bans make the surrogates more vulnerable in a third country,\" Bista says.\nInvestigations by various journalists and rights groups into the lives of surrogate mothers revealed mistreatment in the surrogate houses, a lack of nutritious food and poor hygiene. The surrogates were also often emotionally distressed.\n\"Most of the women said they are happy but their answers seemed rehearsed to me,\" says Janak Sapkota, a local journalist who covered the issue in the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake. \"They missed home, their families and their villages.\"\nEveringham, of Families through Surrogacy, visited Cambodia last year to assess the situation and found it far from ideal.\n\"There is no legislation protecting the rights of the surrogate, child or intended parents,\" he says. \"The ban [in India] will push intended parents to engage in far riskier places like Cambodia, where there is a serious lack of medical support services, such as neonatal care units.\"\n\"There is a strong demand for surrogacy and for people to use surrogates to have their genetic child,\" Henaghan says.\n\"Where there is demand, it will always find a market.\""}

{"prompt": "Is Agunah Tamar Epstein's Remarriage Legal Without Orthodox Divorce?\nEpstein, who has conducted a high-profile, years-long campaign to force her recalcitrant ex-husband to grant her a religious bill of divorce, appeared recently to have found a way around her dilemma.\nTamar Epstein, the prominent \u201cchained woman\u201d whose right to remarry under traditional Jewish law was long stymied, may have finally found two Orthodox rabbis willing to help her wed again. But her fate in the broader Jewish community \u2014 and the fate of any children she may have \u2014 is anything but ensured.\nEpstein, who has conducted a high-profile, years-long campaign to force her recalcitrant ex-husband, a Capitol Hill congressional aide, to grant her a religious bill of divorce, appeared recently to have found a way around her dilemma. Traditional Jewish law bars a woman from remarrying without first receiving such a bill of divorce, even if, like Epstein, she is already civilly divorced. But on September 24, Epstein was", "baseline": "wed to her new husband by a prominent rabbi in Memphis, Tennessee, after an unnamed Philadelphia Orthodox rabbi used a rare procedure to annul Epstein\u2019s earlier marriage.\nThis seemed to end the 33-year-old\u2019s status as an agunah, as such women are known in Hebrew \u2014 a term commonly translated into English as \u201cchained woman.\u201d But this was not necessarily the happy ending that many had hoped she would get.\nThe decision to allow Epstein to remarry ignited a firestorm within the Orthodox community. Opponents of the decision are making it clear that Epstein and any future children she may have will not find acceptance in the Orthodox community of which she considers herself a part.\n\u201cThe woman is considered married for all purposes and is forbidden for any other man until a religious court rules otherwise,\u201d Rabbi Aharon Feldman, head of Baltimore\u2019s Ner Israel Rabbinical College, wrote in an open letter he addressed to fellow rabbis and religious leaders. \u201cIn the meanwhile, she must leave her second \u2018husband,\u2019 and if she has children, they will be considered bastards until relieved by a religious court.\u201d Under traditional Jewish law, children classified as bastards \u2014 mamzerim in Hebrew \u2014 are not allowed to marry other Jews who are born to women considered to be legitimately married.\nEpstein has long become the face of the struggle of chained women in America. A resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, she married Aharon Friedman in 2006; the couple\u2019s only daughter was born a year later. In 2010 she and Friedman decided to separate; they got a civil divorce, but Friedman refused to provide his wife with a get, a religious bill of divorce, which is required under Jewish law to release the wife from the marriage. Epstein thus became an agunah, unable to remarry until her estranged husband grants her the religious divorce.\nEpstein\u2019s plight touched the hearts of many in the metropolitan Washington Orthodox community and led to a series of articles condemning Friedman. Her sympathizers held routine demonstrations outside Capitol Hill, where Friedman works as a congressional staff aide to Rep. Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican. Several area Orthodox synagogues decided to boycott Friedman, not allowing him to pray with the congregation until he signs his wife\u2019s get. But despite the protests, Friedman has refused to grant the religious divorce, reportedly in an attempt to use the refusal to leverage his request for changing visiting rights of the couple\u2019s daughter in his favor.\nSome rabbinical authorities view the breakthrough that allowed Epstein to remarry as a creative solution. But others condemn it as a violation of Jewish law.\nThe breakthrough came earlier this fall, when a rabbinic authority in Philadelphia issued a heter, or permission, that annulled Epstein\u2019s marriage based on the claim that Friedman was mentally ill at the time the couple married. The identity of this rabbinical authority was not disclosed, but according to several ultra-Orthodox websites it was likely to have been Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky, head of the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia. In the past, Kamenetsky has worked to resolve Epstein\u2019s situation.\nAlthough the unnamed rabbinical authority was not provided with any professional mental evaluation of Friedman\u2019s condition, the rabbi ruled that had Epstein known of these mental issues in advance, she would never have married Friedman, and therefore the marriage is annulled and Epstein is free to remarry. Annulment, while existing in traditional Jewish law, is a very rare procedure, and according to a source in the Orthodox community, it has never been used in modern times.\nEpstein\u2019s marriage to Adam Fleischer in a traditional Jewish ceremony in Memphis was officiated by Rabbi Nota Greenblatt, who is the head of the city\u2019s Orthodox umbrella organization, Vaad Hakehilloth, and is a well known halachic authority.\nThe controversy that ensued centered on interpretation of religious law rather than on Epstein\u2019s right to be released from her husband. Even those critical of the unusual halachic procedure were, for the most part, sympathetic to Epstein\u2019s plight. They reiterated their call for Friedman to issue a religious divorce.\nAll parties involved declined to discuss the permission given to Epstein for her subsequent marriage, stating it was a private, personal issue.\nAdvocates of women\u2019s rights under Jewish law were also cautious about the broader implications of this ruling. \u201cThere is a concept of annulment in Jewish law that can be applied in some cases, but I am neutral on this topic,\u201d said Rabbi Jeremy Stern, executive director of the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot, an organization established to help chained women be set free. Stern said his group focuses on the need for divorced men to provide their ex-wives with a get.\nMany rabbis argue that Epstein\u2019s resort to what they view as a questionable procedure is inconsistent with Jewish law and will do nothing to solve the problem.\n\u201cIt is clear at this point that Tamar Epstein is still married to Aharon Friedman \u2014 because the heter she received to remarry is a sad joke based on a clear corruption and misuse of halachic principles,\u201d wrote Rabbi Dovid Eidensohn, one of the ultra-Orthodox community\u2019s leading voices on issues of marriage.\nFurthermore, rabbis who oppose the move are now working to sign up as many rabbinical voices as possible in the Orthodox community, to ensure that, in the future, the community does not accept Epstein\u2019s annulment and the use of the practice.\n\u201cUntil now, there were a few attempts\u201d by rabbis to annul marriages, Feldman wrote. But they changed nothing, \u201cbecause the protest of our rabbis silenced them.\u201d But this time is different. \u201cNow, this permission is coming from an important and significant rabbi, and if we do not protest, our pact will come apart,\u201d Feldman warned."}

Larry Hogan. Both have praised the 34-year-old \u201ctough guy\u201d for putting his own life on the line Tuesday.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s still tragic, he may have saved other people\u2019s lives,\u201d Hogan said of Gaskill in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s shooting.\nGaskill has yet to make a public statement.\nWilleford's brush with fame came after he pursued Texas church shooter Devin Patrick Kelly and shot him dead. He used a rifle similar to the Ruger AR-556 that Kelley used to commit the massacre.\nIt was later revealed that Willeford was a longtime NRA gun instructor \u2014 so the powerful gun lobby, which has been fighting attempts to ban such weapons, was quick to dub him as their kind of hero.\nThey did the same for Gaskill on Tuesday.\nWilleford, who recently was the guest of Rep.

After attending the camp she told her mother she wanted to take riding lessons, and her interest evolved from there.\nSoon, Morris was with a trainer in Chatsworth and at 13 she began training with Karen Healy in Thousand Oaks, who she still works with today. Healy's training reinforces the basics of riding and was influential in getting her experience in shows, Morris said.\nThat is important at the college level because Morris is always riding a different horse. Often, she has to focus so much on controlling different horses with different personalities and tendencies that she has little time to worry about her skills. The experience Healy has given Morris has proven priceless.\n\"I remember [Healy] telling my parents, 'the more you get into the show ring, the less the nerves are going to be and it will just become second nature,' \" Morris said. \"Training with her has helped me out a lot with that.\"\nMorris graduated from La Ca\u00f1ada in 2008 and was a member of the Interscholastic Equestrian League. It was through her participation in IEL that she decided to ride in college because the team-aspect appealed to her.\nAfter deciding she wanted to ride in college during her junior year, Morris prepared a recruiting tape and sent it to the four big riding schools in the NCAA: Georgia, the University of South Carolina, Auburn and Texas A&M. NCAA rules state coaches cannot contact players until July 1 before their senior year in high school.\n\"Literally, that day, July 1, the coach from Georgia called me and said she loved my tape and invited me to come out for a recruiting visit,\" Morris said.\nDuring her recruiting visit, Morris saw all that Georgia had to offer, and it was everything she wanted in a school: a big campus, an elite football program in the South East Conference and a great telecommunications program. The Bulldogs made Morris a great scholarship offer and she signed her letter of intent.\n\"I am so happy with my decision,\" Morris said. \"It is everything I wanted in a college experience.\"\nGeorgia and Boenig are also happy with her decision, as she was named the Most Valuable Player of her team in 2010.\nNot only is Morris a great rider for the Bulldogs, who knows how to push the envelope and impress the judges, but she is a leader as well, Boenig said. She works with the program's freshmen to let them know what to expect during practices and shows.\n\"[Morris] is a technician out there,\" Boenig said. \"She knows exactly how to get a little bit more out of each maneuver and has an incredible feel for whatever horse she is riding. She can get more out of any horse than other riders.\"\nNow the question is: How does Morris improve on her sophomore season where she won nearly every major award available to her?\n\"She wants to continue to be a powerhouse,\" Boenig said. \"I'm going to ask for her to take on a bigger leadership role on the team next year.\"\nMorris said she will continue to concentrate on the goal she's always had of staying consistent in every competition; something she believes is one of the hardest things to do in any collegiate sport.\n\"Honestly, I don't know how it could be any better,\" Morris said. \"But if the next two years I am there we are able to win the team championship again that would just be fantastic.\"\nThe problem is Morris will face a new challenge next year, as opponents will be gunning for her.\n\"It isn't going to be an easy road next year because people are going to remember her,\" Boenig said. \"She has become a moving target and she has to keep moving to stay on top because they are coming back stronger and better prepared for her.\""}

Ward has been charged with three counts of attempted murder and a review has been launched.\nIn response to the shooting, the hospital declared Code Silver, which is designed to alert staff to the existence of a person with a weapon in the hospital and to set off planned emergency procedures.\nCode Silver is the latest colour code that is part of hospital emergency preparedness. It was introduced by the Ontario Hospital Association in 2016, 25 years after a standardized system of colour codes, including Code Orange for an external disaster and Code Red for a fire, was introduced.\nCode Silver is, to a certain extent, a sign of the times, with a steady increase in gun violence across the country.\nWillmore is currently", "baseline": "working on modules to train employees at The Ottawa Hospital on what to do in the event of a Code Silver.\nHospital shootings remain rare in Canada, although that is not the case in the United States. Between 2010 and 2011, there were 154 hospital-based shootings in the U.S., according to one study. Numbers have most likely increased since then.\nOn Monday, while Kingston General was dealing with Code Silver, a police officer, a doctor and a pharmacy resident were all shot at Chicago\u2019s Mercy Hospital.\n\u201cThis is a rather rare event, but not so rare that we can\u2019t pay attention to it,\u201d said Willmore. In fact, he noted, there has been a steady rise in gun violence in Canada \u2014 especially in Ontario \u2014 in recent years.\nKingston is not the first Canadian hospital to be shattered by gunfire. In Cobourg a man shot his wife and then was shot by police at the local hospital in 2017. There have been several other shootings in hospitals across the province in recent years, including in Fort Erie and Northumberland.\nThe Ottawa Hospital, which held a Code Orange training exercise last week based on the scenario of a mass shooting in the community, is, like other hospitals, preparing for a possible shooting within one of its campuses.\nWillmore is working on a 15- to 20-minute simulation module that staff in various departments can do. The exercise gives staff a scenario involving an active shooter in the hospital and takes them through what they should do.\nThe reality of active shooters, though, is that there are few things people can do to remain safe.\nThe options are limited to running, hiding or trying to survive by whatever means possible, Willmore said. That could include fashioning weapon out of equipment in the hospital to try to disarm the shooter. The scenario also raises potentially difficult ethical questions \u2014 including whether to remain with a patient who is unable to hide.\nDr. Alan Drummond, an emergency physician at the Perth hospital and co-chair of public affairs for the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, said there is growing alarm about violence against staff in hospitals, including gun violence."}

I am here with future leaders of our country \u2014 McClatchy students \u2014 where I also studied, but about four decades ago!\nMy parents began their life together in the United States for the same reason that many other families come to this country: to work hard and give their children a better life. Upon leaving Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, they brought with them their faith and not much else. They trusted in the promise of this country that all those who work hard and play by the rules, have earned the opportunity to get ahead.\nI know I am the product of those who fought to open the doors of opportunity. The optimism \u2013 that characterizes the waves of immigrants who have come here \u2013 runs through my blood. And if the state of our nation can be characterized as \u201cstrong,\u201d it is because people like my parents and yours \u2014 citizens or immigrant \u2014 built this country.\nThere is no other country like the United States.\nThe world needs us strong and ready. The world looks to us as a leader and partner.\nHow can it be, then, that our young, rich, and strong nation finds itself in a state of disorder, stress, hostility?\nHow can it be that what defines the state of our country in 2019 is the shutdown of the government at the hands President Trump? And not only once, but perhaps a second time in the coming weeks.\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise us that the majority of people here in the United States think that the country is moving in the wrong direction. And that four out of 10 Americans believe that this is the worst government that they have seen in their life.\nIf President Trump wanted to seriously advance comprehensive immigration reform, including border security, Democrats are and have been ready. But closing our government \u2014 and leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without work or pay \u2014 is not that way to do it.\nWe are ready to reject this foolish proposal, in court, the moment it touches the ground.\n1. They are also putting a wall between you and your doctor, dictating what services you can receive. That is why my fellow Attorneys General and I defend, in court, people like Elizabeth from Florida. Having healthcare coverage allowed her to complete university and ensured that her husband had coverage to defeat cancer. And now, Elizabeth is an attorney.\n2. Also the Trump Administration \u2014 they are putting a wall between you and the voting booth. But I have news for you here: They failed! During the November elections, Latinos, especially young people, came out to vote in historic numbers! Thank you!\n3. What else? They are also putting a wall between our veterans and their medical services. They are ready to waste millions of dollars on a border wall instead of helping our veterans who deal with long delays in hospitals.\n4. And they\u2019re also building a wall between parents and their children, by putting children in cages that separate them from their families.\nNow that you see your power, are you ready to open new doors?\nDon\u2019t you think that it is already the time that we in our government build schools, not walls? Then, get those hands ready to vote in the next election!\nOur system of government rewards the participation of everyone. And with 66,000 Latino citizens reaching 18 years of age, the voting age, every month, we have many hands to reward.\nAnd comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken system: Check! Check! Check!\nIn the courts and in Congress, or at the polls, we have to fight for our agenda. That is why I have fought as Attorney General in court against the President\u2019s Administration and we are winning!\n1. In protecting the DACA program, we fought and won for 700,000 young people.\n2. In protecting the Affordable Care Act, we are the protagonists. More than four million Latinos depend on the ACA for their health insurance.\n3. In protecting college students against fraudulent loans, we fought and won for thousands of them.\nOver the years, they have reaped the fruits of their labor and dedication to their family. There is no doubt that the \u2018State of the Union\u2019 of Maria Teresa and Manuel Becerra is strong and resilient.\nIf you asked my parents what is the state of our Nation, I am sure they would paint an image more real than what President Trump presented tonight. They know what it means to work hard and to respect the rules.\nAnd they know well that to stay strong as a united people, we have to work together and push those heavy doors open so that all our children \u2013 like the students from CK McClatchy \u2013 can walk through them, and have an opportunity.\nWhether it\u2019s with marches on the streets or marches to the polling booths, with fights in the court or through Congress, we will do what\u2019s needed to ensure a strong and vibrant national Union.\nFriends, with faith and the strength of our labor, and respecting the diverse contributions of the American people, the United States will continue to be the home of the American Dream.\nThank you.

{"prompt": "The long wait for Tesla's new Model 3 is almost over.\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will unveil the company's first car for the masses Thursday night. Tesla fans who can't afford the Model S, which costs between $70,000 and $140,000, have eagerly awaited this day for years. The Model 3 will be priced at about $35,000.\nTesla will start taking $1,000 deposits from buyers in stores Thursday morning, and online at 10:30 p.m. ET that night, which is when the car will be unveiled.\nBut there are still more questions than answers about the Model 3. Here's what we do -- and don't -- know about the car.\nWhen can buyers actually get one?\nTesla expects to start delivering the Model 3 in \"late 2017.\" So even if you're one of the first to reserve one, it'll still be a long wait. And ramping up", "baseline": "production can take a while, so it could easily be 2018 before even early buyers can get their hands on a car.\nThe Model 3 will be more like Tesla's Model S sedan than its Model X crossover. But the company has kept the design under wraps. It definitely won't have the distinctive falcon wing doors of the Model X.\nHow far will it go on a charge?\nThe base model Model S has a minimum range of 240 miles, but the Model 3 probably won't go quite as far. The Model 3's battery will be smaller and lighter in order to keep the cost of the car down, and the size of the battery pack is what determines range.\nMusk has been quoted as saying 200 miles should be the minimum range for any all-electric car.\nAt $35,000, the Model 3 will cost about half the price of the base version of the Model S. And buyers will get tax breaks -- there's a $7,500 federal deduction, and some states offer as much as $2,500 in credits. The average price of all new cars today is about $34,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\nWhat options will it offer?\nMusk said in February that Tesla might hold back on some features for the Model 3 to get the car to market faster, having learned a lesson with the much delayed Model X SUV.\n\"In retrospect, it would have better to do fewer things with the first version of Model X, and then roll in ... new technologies over time,\" Musk said. \"I do think that there was some hubris there with the Model X.\"\nOf course, some of the most talked-about Tesla features cost thousands of dollars. If they're available for a Model 3, they could quickly end the car's claim of being a moderately priced for those who add them.\nFor example, the \"ludicrous mode\" that lets the car to go 0 to 60 in only 3 seconds, adds $10,000 to the price of a Model S, and it requires all wheel drive, which adds another $5,000, as well as high performance motors that add $20,000.

{"prompt": "Slowing economic growth in China is taking some of the glow off of one of the country\u2019s greatest attractions for foreign businesses: consumers\u2019 willingness to splurge on higher-priced goods as incomes rise.\nRein is the author of \u201cThe End of Copycat China,\u201d \u201cThe End of Cheap China,\u201d and \u201cThe War for China\u2019s Wallet: Profiting from the New World Order.\u201d Excerpts follow.\nQ. What\u2019s your take on China\u2019s economy?\nA. It\u2019s much weaker than people realize. Labor markets are bad. Starting in October, it became very difficult for even kids from top universities like Stanford and Columbia to get jobs. When we started our business in 2005, they would graduate from the U.S. in June, they looked for a visa in the United States for three or four months, couldn't get one, and then came back to China. It used to take me a week in order for me to hire someone. I'd have to decide very quickly. Even in August 2018, we\u2019d have to decide in a week. Now,", "baseline": "people that I interviewed in October are still looking for jobs. The labor markets collapsed in October.\nSo from a consumer spending standpoint, that's hitting hard. They're starting to trade down. They're skipping the big-ticket items like houses and cars. They're still travelling overseas, but they're going not so much to America or the UK; they're now going more closer -- so Thailand and Japan. We're very bullish on domestic tourism.\nThe next thing is they're just trading down in general. So instead of buying a Starbucks latte, they're going to Luckin. Instead of going to Imax movie theaters, they're watching on iQiyi and online videos. So in 2019, the premiumization drive that a lot of people said consumers would do is over, and they're now trading down. A big shift.\nQ. What does all of this mean for multinationals? To what extent are multinationals caught up in China's mixed relations with the West?\nA. You haven't seen anti-American sentiment on the consumer side except for Apple. Because people feel that the United States is going into hostage diplomacy by arresting (Huawei CFO) Meng Wanzhou, people are supporting Huawei. But, in general, people aren\u2019t buying multinationals\u2019 (goods) not because of the economy and not because they're anti-American. It\u2019s because they're becoming more supportive and more nationalistic when it comes to Chinese brands.\nFor instance, in 2011, we interviewed 5,000 consumers in 15 cities, and at the time 85% of consumers surveyed always buy a foreign brand over a local brand. In 2016, we did the same research. This time, 60% of consumers said they would always buy a domestic Chinese brand over foreign brand. I didn't even do the research in 2017 or last year.\nSo Apple's problems in China are not due to the economy. They're not due to anti-American sentiment. They're due to the fact that they're being out competed by Huawei, Oppo and Vivo at a much better price points.\nQ. How are multinationals as a group reacting to all of this?\nA. They're getting hit very hard. The only brands that are doing well would be heritage brands that have an incredible brand position \u2013 a Nike, Chanel, Estee Lauder. Other brands are in confused mode. They think it's the economy, but it's not. They need to adjust. They need to understand that the day Chinese just desire Western brands is over.\nQ. How should they adjust?\nA. They either need to buy a Chinese firm. They need to either go even more upmarket, in some cases they have to offer more value products.\nQ. Any recent examples of a multinational buying a Chinese firm? Multinational?\nA. You don't want to go too down. What you want to do is offer more like, \u201cBuy five, get five.\u201d It's more of a value play.\nA. The food market is a difficult one because companies are getting hit by Ele.me and Meituan. Anything that's 30 RMB and less is dead, because people can just buy something at half of the price. So you need to try to go more upmarket, be a little bit of premium, a little bit healthier. And then you're able to win. It's not easy.\nQ. That's what Yum is trying to do?\nA. That's what they're trying to do. I'm very negative on say McDonald's. All these guys earn a lot of trouble. For the first time in about a decade, I'm bullish on instant noodles. People are starting to buy the cheap three or four (yuan) noodles again.\nQ. When is this going to end?\nA. This is a long time period. The economy is a lot worse than people realize. None of my clients are making a lot of money. If nobody's making money, how on earth are you getting six percent growth\uff1f I just I can't figure it out.\nA. There are two things hitting autos. First, prices are so high and people are concerned about their savings, and so they're skipping autos. It's hitting the American brands because of the tariffs. People are buying a Lexus and they're still buying a BMW because China has lowered the tariffs from Germany and Japan, but people are not buying American brands. You saw Ford\u2019s sales dropped 50% year on year in the fourth quarter. And you also have the issue where people to use shared mobility. That's a big trend in China because it's very difficult to buy a license plate. It's expensive. I've never been able to get one. My company has had to buy all of my license plates and they cost $30,000 each. So the American auto manufacturers are in a lot of trouble. They're going to continue to double-digit (sales) drops this year.\nNow the second thing is people are hoping for an end of the trade war and they're saying if there is an end to the trade war China might lower the tariffs on cars even more. So people are taking a wait and see attitude to see is it going to be cheaper in three months. And that's what's happened with Tesla. They're waiting for when Tesla opens their factory in China in May, or when they lower their prices which they just did last week by $20,000-30,000. So the market for American autos in China is in trouble because people have no money, or if they have money, they have a wait and see attitude.\nQ. What does this shared economy mean for foreign businesses? It\u2019s easy to think of Chinese companies like Didi benefitting and maybe a Geely, which seems to be building up a fleet to supply that sector.\nA. It\u2019s too expensive to own a car in China, and a lot of Chinese -- younger Chinese especially -- tell us they don't even want to drive. It's too stressful, too much traffic, too expensive and too much risk of an accident. They'd much rather outsource driving either to a driver or autonomous cars.\nQ. Where can foreign companies fit into the shared space?\nA. What they can do is sell fleets. But if they sell fleets to the taxi companies, that lowers their brand image. Hyundai did that with the taxi companies; now nobody wants to buy a Hyundai. They could invest in some of the Chinese Internet players and do co-partners partnerships with them."}

The offices are overcrowded, understaffed, and the needed paperwork doesn\u2019t exist (many Dominicans of Haitian descent were born in rural areas, since their parents came to work the sugar fields, with midwifes and not in hospitals, and were therefore never issued birth certificates).\nAs of the 17th, hundreds of thousands of Haitians and Dominican-Haitians here will be rendered stateless and eligible for summary detention and deportation. The Dominican government maintains that they will not delay implementation of the law, despite pressure from the US, the UN, the OAS, and the Pope.\nThe government also announced last week that they do not intend to deport those who have already registered for legalization. However, I am documenting dozens of personal accounts from Dominican-Haitians who have gone to great lengths to register, some as much as 8-9 months ago, and as of today have not received any type of confirmation that their paperwork has even been processed. Without confirmation, they are still eligible for deportation. This does not even consider the hundreds of thousands of others who lack birth certificates and thus could not register in the first place.\nGiven the common practice of nightly police sweeps, the government solicitation of passenger buses, the official declaration of intent to pass Law 169-14 without delay on June 16, and the general history of anti-Haitian abuses on the part of law enforcement and government authorities, it is reasonable to assume that the infrastructure is now in place for mass detention and deportation of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic. The general attitude among this vulnerable subpopulation is a mix of fear and resignation.\nThis aid worker is asking for contacts in the US press; he wants to stay anonymous but wants to report on what he sees over the next week, especially in poorer neighborhoods, where he has contacts and first-hand experience.

The plot moves slowly, like a man on horseback, as Audiard oscillates between the brothers and Morris tailing Warm. The film, set at the height of the Gold Rush, is lean on plot and heavy on character study, with the brothers regularly trading barbs and punches on their way to San Francisco, where all four characters will connect, much to the story\u2019s benefit.\nBe warned: \u201cSisters Brothers\u201d is not for the squeamish.

{"prompt": "Dave Eggers' history as the motive force behind the experimental, expectations-challenging literary-goofery platform McSweeney's hangs heavily over his new book, What Is The What. Simultaneously billed as an autobiography and a novel, it does manage to be both: Eggers interviewed Sudanese refugee Valentino Achak Deng at length about his life, then wove his horrifying story into a fictionalized narrative. Eggers' stagy, novelistic writing is jarring, and it inevitably casts every given fact into doubt. But while it's sometimes hard to take the literary tropes seriously, the autobiographical content is riveting, and in all likelihood, more accessible than any similarly massive, sprawling non-fiction treatise on Sudan's politics.\nEggers frames Deng's story with a break-in at his home: Living as a political refugee in America, Deng is assaulted and robbed in his apartment, and his ordeal stretches out throughout 475 pages as, suffering, he recalls how he suffered as", "baseline": "a child in Sudan. A child of an African tribe, the Dinka, he grows up in an ethnically mixed area, but political events far away forcibly set Arab tribesmen from north Sudan against the Africans in the south.

When Arab horsemen destroy Deng's village, he starts a lengthy journey that lasts more than a decade and leads to multiple countries and refugee camps.\nEggers skims over the region's voluminous religious and political divides, presenting a bare-bones version of events and concentrating on the increasingly wild rumors and hopes that the refugees live by, and on the mundane details of life for a lost child in a generation of them. In his oddest conceit, his version of Deng mentally addresses each new installment of his story to the individuals he encounters or remembers, evoking their names over and over as he describes his heartbreaking journey. He isn't telling an abstract story to the air, he's recounting his own life directly and determinately to real people, demanding that they hear and see him.

{"prompt": "Your credit card company doesn't have your best interests at heart.\nCredit cards have caused financial pain for millions of consumers. It's easy to run up a balance, but as too many people find out the hard way, it's a lot harder to get it paid down. Even if you're diligent about getting your debt repaid, high interest rates work against you, creating a big headwind that's hard to fight against month after month.\nEven your credit card issuer's own policies can tempt you into staying in debt a lot longer than you should. By simply ignoring your card company's advice and doing what most people would logically think of as the right way to pay down debt, you can get your card balances zeroed out years sooner. Below, we'll show you how to do it and why so many people don't.\nThe problem that so many credit card holders run into has to do with the minimum payment provisions that card companies have. You'd think that a lender would want to get repaid as soon as possible, but that's actually not the case for credit card companies. The opportunity to charge double", "baseline": "-digit interest rates in an environment where mortgage loans generate less than 5% interest for lenders encourages lenders to keep those card balances as high as possible for as long as they can.\nAs a result, the minimum payment provisions that many card companies use don't do much to pay down your outstanding balance. One common provision involves having someone repay the greater of 2% of their balance or $25 each month. That might sound like a lot, but when interest charges eat up more than half of those payments, there's not much left to apply toward reducing the principal you owe.\nAs a simple example, say that you have a $5,000 balance on a credit card that charges a 17% annual interest rate. Using the 2% or $25 rule, your minimum payment will start out at $100. Of that amount, more than $70 will go toward paying the interest on your $5,000 balance. The remainder will go toward paying down your debt slightly.\nThe next month, your balance will be about $30 lower, so your minimum payment will be incrementally lower, at $99.42. Because you owe slightly less money, your interest due will be lower, but it won't drop by as much as the minimum payment did. Over the ensuing months, you'll find that you pay down principal at a slower and slower rate, as your minimum payments fall.\nIt'll take you almost 10 years just to get your debt halfway paid off if you follow the strategy of paying just the monthly payment. Even after $25 minimum payments kick in around year 20, it'll still take you another seven years to zero out your balance. Over that 27-year period, you'll pay more than $10,000 in interest charges -- double the initial amount you borrowed in the first place.\nFortunately, there's a way to slash the time it takes to get out of debt and the interest you have to pay. Since you have to make that initial $100 minimum payment, it's reasonable to think that you can afford to keep making $100 payments in future months as well. Even if that's the only thing you change, the impact is immense.\nIn the example above, if you make sustained $100 monthly payments on your credit card, you'll get that debt paid down in a bit more than seven years. You'll pay roughly $3,750 in interest over that time frame -- producing interest savings of more than $6,000 along the way. The simple reason: Your $100 monthly payments ensure that an increasing amount of money goes toward paying down principal month after month, and the resulting faster decline in your card balance cuts your interest charges, creating a positive feedback loop that makes it easier to get your debt paid off.\nIt does take discipline to make more than the monthly payments you owe on your cards. Your bank is never going to encourage you to do so, and in fact, you can expect financial institutions to dangle offers that make it easier for you to take on more debt.\nBut being out of debt is a financial necessity, especially when it comes to credit cards. With such high interest charges, it pays to dig yourself out of credit card debt as quickly as you can, and simple strategies like this one can make it a whole lot easier."}
{"prompt": "Sascha Segan MiFi 500 LTE by Novatel Wireless (Sprint) The Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nRemovable battery. Solid Wi-Fi range. Supports Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nVery basic on-device display. No external antenna port. No global roaming support.\nThe Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nNeed a solid, workhorse hotspot to use on Sprint's network? The Novatel MiFi 500 LTE (free with contract) is a reliable choice, besting its main competitor the Netgear Zing on our tests of speed and range. The Zing beats it out for an Editor's Choice based on its flexibility (especially with its optional desktop cradle), but the MiFi 500 is the one to go to if you need to blanket a larger area with Sprint Wi-Fi.", "baseline": "\nThe MiFi 500 LTE is a nondescript little brick, when compared to the zingy Zing. It's a plastic puck, 3.8 by 2.4 by .7\" (HWD) and 3.35 ounces, made of shiny black plastic on top and soft-touch gray plastic around the sides. The back is removable, so you can replace the 1800mAh battery; I haven't found replacement batteries on the market yet, but I'm sure they're coming. The MiFi lacks an external antenna port.\nThere's a big gray power button on the top face, as well as a few physical navigation buttons. Hit the power button and the dim little OLED screen lights up with signal strength and battery indicators. By flipping through onscreen menus, you can find the Wi-Fi network name and password, check which devices are connected to the hotspot, check signal strength in dBm, and activate WPS setup.\nYou get many more management options on the simple, clear Web-based management portal. There, you can monitor your data usage, and set up your 2.4GHz-only 802.11 b/g/n network using VPN passthrough, DMZ, port filtering, and port forwarding.\nThe MiFi supports up to 10 Wi-Fi devices and can connect to an eleventh as a USB modem; plugging it into a Mac or PC it works right away, without installing any drivers. With an extra driver, it gives your PC GPS support.\nThe MiFi 500, unlike the Zing, is not world-capable. It only works on Sprint's 3G EVDO and tri-band LTE networks. Also note that Sprint's \"unlimited\" sales pitch doesn't apply to hotspots; all hotspot plans are capped, costing $34.99 for 3GB, $49.99 for 6GB or $79.99 for 12GB.\nTesting Sprint's new LTE network in New York City is an exercise in frustration. It's spotty and inconsistent, strongest in remote parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn. I had to use the Sensorly mapping app to find individual towers that Sprint had activated in Manhattan and Queens, and even then, the network showed a weird behavior with upload tests truncating early.\nThe reason to buy the new MiFi and Zing is that they support Sprint's new tri-band approach to LTE. Sprint has been taking its existing 1900MHz LTE network and supplementing it with 800MHz, which does much better at penetrating buildings, and 2600MHz, which should provide scorching speed in urban areas. Unfortunately, Sprint's buildout there is even less developed than their 1900MHz buildout, and we haven't had a chance to test the mixed coverage.\nBut you get what you get, and you try not to get upset. We tested LTE with the MiFi and Zing in five locations. In three of them, the MiFi was considerably faster. In one, the Zing prevailed, and in the last one, the MiFi dropped to 3G while the Zing pulled out decent LTE speeds.\nIndoors, the MiFi showed much better range than the Zing. While the Zing's speeds started to drop off after about 50 feet, the MiFi held on well to about 100 feet.\nThe Zing also showed slightly longer battery life than the MiFi\u2014although remember, the MiFi's battery life really wins because the battery is replaceable. I got 7 hours, 40 minutes with the MiFi compared to 7 hours, 55 minutes with the Zing.\nIf you're looking for a Sprint hotspot and need long WiFi range without a cradle, the MiFi 500 is your pick. The Netgear Zing is more manageable and flexible, it roams worldwide, and it supports external antennas, so it's a better choice for most people.\nIf you have a Sierra Wireless Tri-Fi, I'd say hold onto it for now. Sprint just hasn't built out enough of its tri-band LTE network for the advantages to kick in quite yet. I'd peg early 2014 for when these hotspots will start opening up speed and coverage advantages over the Tri-Fi.\nBottom Line: The Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network."}

{"prompt": "I have to admit \u2013 I\u2019m a huge breakfast person. But this Friday, waking up late for my 10 meant that I had to skip the most important meal of the day. Stomach grumbling, I made it through the end of my 11 and a meeting with just one thought keeping me going \u2013 eating The Box for lunch.\nFor those who have been away from campus or buried away in the stacks for a while, The Box is Dartmouth\u2019s first food truck, founded by Tuck students, a non-DDS option for hungry students. Due to my meal-planning ineptitude, I was ready to try everything The Box had to offer by the time lunchtime rolled around. Luckily, the options were good and I grabbed a sandwich, side and dessert before settling down on a nearby bench and enjoying a rare burst of Hanover sunshine.\nMy first and only experience with falafel prior to this meal was during my foreign study program last term, when our group stopped by a well-known stand in Paris before proceeding to walk to the nearest metro station. In that short", "baseline": "time, I managed to leave a messy trail of morsels from my falafel concoction down the sidewalks of the City of Lights. Classy, I know.\nThis time was no different \u2013 I proceeded to get those \u201cmixed greens\u201d all over my bench and self, desperately digging through my backpack for a spare napkin I had luckily stashed in there earlier in the term for emergencies like this. Despite my consumption struggles, I definitely enjoyed the sandwich. The salsa added a nice tangy flavor that blended well with the rest of the ingredients. The pita bread is also advertised as being made fresh every morning, which definitely added to the experience. Just don\u2019t attempt to eat it gracefully on a date or something.\nThe granola was exciting because in my opinion, the nutty mixes tend to be pretty hit-or-miss. In this case, The Box\u2019s was a definite hit \u2013 not only could I eat chocolate and still pretend to be healthy, but it had just the right balance of sweetness and saltiness with the nuts added in. If you need a quick snack that gives you energy and tastes delicious, this is a great option.\nSadly, The Box was out of their raved-about salted chocolate chip and oat cookie by the time I got there, so I opted for the other dessert option instead. The truffle had bits of date in it and tasted a bit nutty. It was slightly bitter, so I\u2019d recommend it if you want a dessert that\u2019s not too sweet. Next time I may try to get there earlier for the cookie, though.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend giving The Box a try at least once this term, though any more than that may put a bit of a dent in your wallet. I personally tend to have leftover DBA at the end of the term, so it\u2019s hard to justify putting down 12 dollars for (an albeit delicious) lunch. I would also love to see more variety in the future \u2014 being able to customize your meal with a sandwich, salad or grain bowl is nice but having only three meal options to create them with caters toward limited palates. Still, The Box offers a nice alternative on Tuck Drive for when you just can\u2019t stand another grim Novack lunch while doing work for your 2."}

{"prompt": "The Nokia Lumia 900 is the top of the Finns' range of Windows Phone handsets with a huge screen and 8-megapixel camera -- but can it offer enough to beat the best of Android?\nAt first glance, the Lumia 900 looks very similar to the slightly smaller Lumia 800, with similar colourful plastic shell. Come a little closer though and you'll notice the 4.3-inch screen, making it a much more substantial handful than the 800's 3.7-incher.\nBehind its protective Gorilla Glass the AMOLED touchscreen offers 800x480-pixel resolution, which is perfectly respectable but it's not among the sharpest, scraping in behind the iPhone, HTC One S and Samsung Galaxy S3. Even the 800 is a little sharper, since it squeezes the same pixel count into its smaller screen. It's beautifully sensitive though, and Nokia's ClearBlack technology offers rich contrast with exceptionally deep, dark blacks offsetting the slightly", "baseline": "oversaturated colours.\nConsidering the price and the 900's place at the top of the Windows Phone tree, it's disappointing that it only offer a single-core 1.4GHz processor, especially since its rivals are now routinely offering dual-core or even quad-core handsets. Still, it ain't slow, and the relative simplicity of the Windows OS certainly seems to be in its favour, since it whips through the apps with ease, even when you have a bunch of them open and running.\nThe latest Windows Phone 7.5 Mango is the operating system, which is beautiful to look at, and easy to find your way around, even if you're a Windows Phone newbie. Facebook and Twitter are incorporated into the OS, so once you've set up your accounts, Facebook pictures and the latest tweets will start appearing on the dynamic tiles on your homepage. Disappointingly though, as with other Mango handsets, the 900 won't be making the jump to Windows Phone 8 Apollo when it comes along later this year.\nNokia Music, with its selections of playlisted music that you can stream for free; Local Scout also GPS to help you find some even rather obscure local stuff and there's a full version of the Microsoft Office suite on board too.\nThe browser looks good, but still lacks Flash support, so you won't be able to play all the video that's available, and the YouTube app is still only a link to the website, which is a shame.\nThe 8-megapixel camera comes with a Carl Zeiss lens, as we expect from the higher quality Nokia handsets. It opens quickly with a long push on the shutter button on the side and offers a range of settings to play with. Probably too many settings actually, unless you know what you're after when you're playing around with contrast, saturation, exposure, ISO, metering and white balance.\nDetail isn't quite as good as it should be and less than perfect light conditions were quick to throw up issues with noise.

{"prompt": "When it comes to corruption and Congress, the line the law polices is the wrong line, writes Lawrence Lessig.\nSeven years after moving from the federal capital to a federal prison, former congressman (and top gun Navy pilot) Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham (R-CA) is going home. Convicted of bribery for trying to sell defense contracts for $2.4 million in cash and yachts, Cunningham was sentenced to what was then the harshest punishment ever meted out to a bribe-taking congressman.\nThe United States Congress needs the likes of Cunningham. Because the rare conviction of a member doing something plainly wrong reaffirms the claim of the others on Capitol Hill that they are not like him. Cunningham was a crook. He engaged in classic quid-pro-quo bribery. But no one credible believes that there are many more that stupid or perfidious. Congress is filled neither with top guns nor with craven criminals. And therefore, its leaders would have us believe, Congress is not corrupt.\nBut what the", "baseline": "conviction of Cunningham should teach us is not that other members Congress should be trusted, but that the line the law polices is the wrong line. Sure, Cunningham was an exception, along with the man who broke his record for harshest sentence, William Jefferson (D-LA), who began a 13-year sentence last year, after federal agents found $90,000 in his freezer and tied that money to a $400,000 bribe. But corruption on Capitol Hill, in the plain meaning of the term that the Framers of our Constitution would have recognized, is endemic.\nCunningham reduced his deal to a very explicit transaction\u2014literally, he wrote it down. In a bizarre note scribbled on his office stationery, Cunningham gave his co-conspirators a simple (if confused) schedule of how much it would cost to get the defense contracts they were seeking. What made his behavior a crime was this quid pro quo\u2014not just that he would benefit personally; Cunningham would have been just as guilty if the payment was to be a campaign contribution rather than a yacht.\nSuch blatant exchanges don\u2019t happen much\u2014either for personal or for political benefit. But a more complicated dance certainly does. As lobbyists make their clients' cases to members of Congress, those members certainly know just how much those lobbyists have helped. That help isn\u2019t a crime. Indeed, lobbyists are meticulous in keeping their behavior within formal ethical lines. But even within those lines, influence is peddled. And for members starved for campaign funds, even a very little bit can go a long way.\nThe economy of that dance plainly corrupts Congress. Because rather than staying focused\u2014as Madison promised they would be\u2014\u201cupon the People alone,\u201d Congress is increasingly focused upon it funders.\nYet those funders are not America. They are the tiniest slice of America. No more than 1/20th of 1 percent of us give enough to count as a relevant funder of a congressional campaign. And as members spend hours every day frantically trying to find some of that 0.05 percent who might help, they learn the words their funders want to hear. Remember the Skinner Box\u2014a rat in a cage frantically trying to figure out which buttons it must push to get its pellets of food\u2014and you have a good sense of the life of a congressman.\nThat dance does more harm to the Republic than an aircraft carrier full of Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunninghams ever could. For it is that sort of influence that steered Congress to deregulate Wall Street, that drives Congress to ignore climate change, and that says Congress can pass health-care reform only by including a $250 billion subsidy to insurance companies and Big Pharma.\nYet there\u2019s nothing in the law to police this sort of corruption. Indeed, if Justice Kennedy really believes his own rhetoric in Citizens United, it may well be that the First Amendment would even ban an effort to limit this sort of corruption. And thus are we protected against the harmless sins, but are constitutionally required to remain vulnerable to radically more harmful ones.\nCunningham is a reminder of what\u2019s not wrong with Congress. Congress is not a bunch of crooks. What Congress is is a democratic institution that, according to the latest Rasmussen Poll, can\u2019t even garner more than 6 percent of the public\u2019s approval. And that\u2019s not because we don\u2019t like what Congress does. It is instead because, as John R. Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse have powerfully demonstrated, we \u201cbelieve special interests have hijacked the political process.\u201d They\u2014meaning almost all of Congress, not just the Cunninghams\u2014are not in it for us, most of us believe. They\u2019re in it for the funders and the funder\u2019s agents, the lobbyists.\nThere are many contexts in which the law is obsessed with the relatively harmless sins while oblivious to undeniably harmful ones. But there is none as significant as this. America\u2019s government doesn\u2019t work because it refuses to grok this most obvious of corruptions. And until it does, it\u2019s not just defense contracts that will get lost. It is practically every important decision that our government must make."}

Netanyahu, say the officials, is willing to cross the river but wants to know if Abbas will do the same.

Wendy Sullivan, an attorney and", "baseline": "planning consultant, is co-author.\nThe paper gives the city's community groups much of the credit for fighting City Hall in a long-running effort to keep San Francisco a racially and economically diverse community.\n\"Once notorious for urban renewal that diminished housing affordability and displaced residents,\" the paper says, \"San Francisco is now renowned nationally for its best practices in housing and community development.\"\nDespite \"limited land for development, extremely low rental vacancy rates and high demand for housing,\" over decades the city has developed \"thoughtful policies designed to preserve and enhance housing opportunities ... prevent displacement of low-income families and create inclusive communities,\" the authors say.\nBy providing examples of local innovations that work, similar efforts can be adopted by other cities and, ultimately, find their way into federal housing policy, said Philip Tegeler, president of the action council, a civil rights policy organization.\nSan Francisco \"provides an example of how community advocacy can work,\" he said. \"Cities need diversity. They need workers as well as executives.\"\nIt took time for local officials to realize that. The redevelopment projects of the '60s bulldozed chunks of the Western Addition and Yerba Buena, sending poor and middle-income residents packing to make way for wider streets, commercial development and civic projects. Aging residential hotels were razed in the name of progress, with little or no concern about what would happen to the people who called those places home.\nBut neighborhood and tenant organizations quickly formed to battle against the demolition efforts, filing lawsuits and gathering political support. As they won some battles, they pushed ahead with efforts to provide relocation help for ousted residents, limit evictions, ban residential hotel demolitions and require low-income housing and other programs.\nThe city's affordable housing movement wasn't just the product of the progressive community and angry tenants. For example, San Francisco voters passed limits on office construction in 1986, a $100 million affordable housing bond in 1996 and, earlier this month, a $50 million housing trust fund.\nSupport for affordable housing in the city \"doesn't just come down from the policy level,\" said Tiffany Bohee, who deals with a number of housing plans as executive director of the city's Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure. \"The voters have signaled resoundingly that this is what they want us to do.\"\nThe change documented in the paper has been dramatic. Although more than 3,200 housing units destroyed by urban renewal in the Western Addition were never replaced, the Rincon Point-South Beach redevelopment project - which added 2,800 units, 24 percent of them low-income, along with commercial space, parkland and AT&T Park - was built without destroying any housing.\nRosen's paper provides a look at the nuts and bolts of the city's housing wars, showing how activists took a little-noticed, grassroots liberal cause and made it so much a part of San Francisco's political mainstream that a former tenants' attorney is now the city's mayor.\n\"The business community and parts of the development community have signed on, realizing that affordable housing helps jobs and the city's economy,\" Rosen said. \"The process has been about building support in San Francisco and making it a place where nurses, teachers, restaurant workers and hotel workers can live.\""}

It has limitations,\" said Nandakumara Sarma, director of dietary supplements for US Pharmacopeia, which sets quality standards and testing protocols for drugs, vitamins and supplements.\nThe United Natural Products Alliance, a trade group, says it is sending people out around the country to buy large quantities of the supplements cited by Schneiderman and submit the bottles, unopened, to five or six certified botanical testing labs for analysis.\n\"They will perform universally accepted methods and procedures to test the products and will independently report their findings, which will be made public,\" said Loren Israelsen, the group's president. \"We feel the most appropriate response to bad science is good science.\"\nThe American Botanical Council, a nonprofit research and education organization based in Austin, Texas, was particularly critical of the Guelph study.\n\"We raised the question if any of these products are extracts, and if so, what other analytical technologies were used to help ensure the validity of the results obtained by DNA testing,\" said Mark Blumenthal, the council's founder and director.\n\"DNA testing seldom is able to properly identify chemically complex herbal extracts, because often DNA doesn't get through the extraction process,\" Blumenthal said.\nHe said at least some of the products cited by Schneiderman are likely made from extracts, which can be validated by other common lab tests.\nTod Cooperman, president of the consumer-funded ConsumerLab.com, also dismissed the Guelph and attorney general's DNA studies as inappropriate for validating herbal supplements.\n\"There are definitely problems with herbal supplements but this is not the right method to test those products,\" Cooperman said.\nHis lab performs a range of tests on vitamins, herbal products and other dietary supplements to determine quality and purity, and provides the results to consumers who subscribe to his service.\nBlumenthal also is working to expose bad products. He launched the Botanical Adulterants Program four years ago to ferret out suppliers who sell adulterated or mislabeled ingredients to manufacturers of herbal supplements. One goal of the program is to identify what laboratory tests are most effective.\nPieter Cohen, a Harvard Medical School researcher whose area of expertise is tracking down dangerous supplements, said the new versions of methamphetamine he has found in diet and sports supplements would never be spotted by DNA testing.\n\"There is so much wrong with the quality of supplements today that it's a shame the New York attorney general is not using sound science to focus on the most important problems,\" Cohen said. \"The FDA has done hundreds of spot inspections of supplement companies, and they have found that 7 in 10 are not compliant with basic manufacturing practices.\"\nSchneiderman's office stands by the validity of its DNA testing.\n\"Rather than attacking testing methods that have been validated by more than 70 published papers, the time has come for the herbal supplements industry to put concerns about what is and is not included in its products to rest,\" Matt Mittenthal, spokesman for the attorney general, said in an email.\nThe attorney general's office did not respond to a follow-up email asking why conventional, widely accepted testing wasn't used to verify the DNA test results, which would have made the findings more indisputable.\nUS Pharmacopeia provides independent third-party certification to drug and supplement manufacturers, who can then use the certification to assure consumers their products are genuine.\nBut John Atwater, director of verification programs for the organization, said less than 1 percent of herbal supplements carry the USP mark.\nHe noted the program is voluntary. \"It's up to manufacturers and consumers to demand it,\" he said."}

For example, columnist Paul Krugman wrote on his New York Times blog in 2010 that \"the payroll tax is regressive, as are most state and local taxes, which largely offsets the progressivity of the income tax.\" And President Clinton's secretary of labor, Robert Reich, said in an October 2007 blog post, \"payroll taxes take a much bigger portion of the paychecks of lower-income Americans than of higher-income [Americans]. Viewed as a whole, the current tax system is", "baseline": "quite regressive.\"\nOn the contrary, studies show that the Social Security and Medicare programs, viewed as a whole, are anything but regressive.\nThe payroll taxes that fund these programs are collected for the express purpose of providing income supplements and medical care during retirement. In the case of Social Security, earned income is taxed proportionately at 12.4% (split evenly between employee and employer) up to a cap that is currently set at $110,100. Those who assert that the Social Security tax is regressive note that the income cap results in a decline in taxes paid as a percentage of income as income rises above the cap. But this observation omits three critical facts.\nFirst, the amount of one's Social Security income at retirement is also capped. Second, higher-income workers receive less of a benefit as a percentage of their contributions than do lower-income workers. The payouts to retirees are, and are intended to be, redistributive. Third, Social Security income is subject to the income tax\u2014and the income tax is progressive.\nGiven the design of Social Security, the only way the program could be regressive is if the mortality rate differences between the group of higher-income and lower-income workers were so large that higher-income people received greater lifetime benefits for each dollar contributed. But this is not the case, according to a 2009 study by the Social Security Administration's Office of Retirement and Disability Policy. Rather, the study concludes that \"Social Security is modestly progressive on a lifetime basis; currently, the program lies approximately halfway between paying a benefit directly proportional to lifetime taxable earnings and paying a flat dollar benefit to each retiree.\"\nIn the case of Medicare, the amount paid into the system\u20142.9% of income, split evenly between employee and employer\u2014is proportionate to income and has no cap. So a person with a lifetime income of $5 million will pay five times as much into the system as a person with a lifetime income of $1 million.\nIn theory, therefore, the benefits provided by Medicare (paid health care) should be the same for each beneficiary. And like Social Security, lifetime benefits are affected by differences in mortality rates among different income groups (the poor tend to die younger). However, lower-income beneficiaries are more likely to become ill than higher-income beneficiaries and thus consume more benefits. Higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to privately insure or pay out of pocket in old age, thus reducing their demands on the system.\nSo what is the bottom line? Based on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, health economists Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Darius Lakdawalla of USC found that the poorest groups receive the most benefits at any given age, and that this advantage in benefits received significantly outweighs the fact that as a group, they die younger. The authors' 2006 study \"Does Medicare Benefit the Poor?\" was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Economics. On the whole, the authors conclude that \"Medicare is an extraordinarily progressive public program, in dollar terms or welfare terms.\"\nThe studies suggest that both of the payroll-tax systems are progressive, not regressive. Moreover, according to a July 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, entitled \"The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009,\" the entire U.S. federal tax system (including the earned-income tax, the various capital income taxes, the two types of payroll taxes, the corporate tax, and the excise tax) is also progressive.\nThose who assert that \"the rich\" do not pay their \"fair share\" seem to be ignoring these other facts: A study released in 2008 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported the U.S. federal income tax system is the most progressive of any of the 24 countries of its member nations. And an October 2011 report by the Tax Foundation noted that in 2009 the top 1% of U.S. earners\u2014who earned 17% of the income\u2014paid 37% of the taxes. The top 5% earned 32% of the income and paid 59% of the taxes. The bottom 50% paid 2.3% of taxes, and the bottom quintile received money back in the form of refundable tax credits.\nThose who would increase the marginal rates paid by the top income earners must confront the depressing effect that higher taxes will have on business creation and expansion\u2014and on jobs. Giving a bigger piece of a smaller economic pie to lower-income earners is not likely to be in America's interest."}

However, the Eagles (14-11, 3-9) responded with back-to-back layups to cut the deficit in half before senior forward Jessica Shepard poured in four points of her own as well as a steal to spark another Irish run.

However, the real damage came in the remaining seven minutes, as Ogunbowale and co. went on a 26-2 run. This offensive performance saw all five starters contribute, as well as freshman guard Abby Prohaska. The reserve guard stepped up in the absence of fellow rookie guard Jordan Nixon, who injured her hamstring during warmups. Prohaska finished with four points, two rebounds and two steals.\nMcGraw credited this impressive performance in part due to the absence of Boston College junior starting guard Taylor Ortlepp, who was out of the lineup with an ankle injury. Although Ortlepp only contributed three points in the Eagle\u2019s 29-point loss to the Irish on Jan. 20, she has proven to be a solid leader, averaging 11.6 points per game to go along with her 35.6 percent shooting from long range.\nHaving built a 59-point lead, the Irish lost some of their momentum in the final frame, allowing 18 points \u2014 as many as they did in the entire first half combined.

{"prompt": "DPR members Jim Ragsdale, Diane Kane, Angeles Liera and pro tem chair Mike Costello discuss condo conversion projects.\nDuring the Jan. 10 meeting of the La Jolla Development Permit Review committee (DPR), board members voted unanimously to form a research subcommittee that will look into the consequences of condo conversion in the neighborhoods south of Pearl Street.\n\u201cThe issue with the condo conversions in this particular neighborhood is that you\u2019ve got two units on a lot and the proposals we\u2019re getting are essentially lot-splits that put an imaginary line across the lot, making two smaller lots that don\u2019t comply with what is zoned in the code for that area,\u201d said board member Diane Kane during her presentation on the topic.\nIn the past year, DPR members have reviewed three condo conversions of existing dwelling units, two of them in the area south of Pearl Street (7432-7436 Fay Ave. and 7435-7437 Eads Ave.) and a third in WindanSea, the second area where trustees have identified the", "baseline": "problem (247-249 Kolmar St.).

But when you only have two units on a lot, and they are separate, and they share no property in common, it doesn\u2019t seem to meet the requirements for a condo. So, why is the City allowing the condo conversion process to be used for this particular situation?\u201d she elaborated.\nThe City has mechanisms in place to keep affordable housing within the Coastal Zone, but those can be waived by a contribution of an in-lieu fee to the San Diego Housing Trust Fund, and most developers in La Jolla pay rather than give up units for low- or medium-income families.\nWith the added concern of residents, DPR members agreed that something has to be done to better serve the community when reviewing condo conversion projects. Trustee Liera proposed perusing the San Diego Municipal Code for requirements \u201cdangling around\u201d in different sections and making a checklist for applicants, so they\u2019d know what to bring in when they present to DPR.\nThe committee unanimously approved a motion to form a condo-conversion research subcommittee whose ad-hoc members are trustees Kane, Liera and Brian Will.

{"prompt": "Unfortunately, Sir James Robertson\u2019s plan succeeded partly because leading southern politicians, especially Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Chief Obafemi Awolowo, failed to put in abeyance their personal egos and radioactive Igbo-versus-Yoruba rivalry in order to present a united front against Robertson and Balewa. That said, as Premiers of their respective regions, Dr. Azikiwe, Chief Awolowo and Alhaji Ahmadu Bello (whose tenure as Premier of the northern region was tragically terminated during the first military coup in January 15, 1966) performed creditably by implementing programmes that benefitted a significant percentage of the population.\nBut Azikiwe and Awolowo were by far more attuned to the institution of democracy than the jihadist-oriented Sardauna because of their exposure to solid western education and secular democratic values, whereas Ahmadu Bello was hampered by his limited academic credentials, serious educational disadvantage of the northern region generally as well as by his fixation to outdated Islamic weltanschauung and way of life", "baseline": ".\nIndeed, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the most powerful northern politician of the First Republic, never really believed in the concept of a united democratic Nigeria. He single-mindedly pursued a northernisation agenda such that that he preferred filling vacant positions in the northern region\u2019s civil service and educational institutions where qualified northerners were unavailable with foreigners on contract basis rather than employ southerners, particularly the Igbo. His narrow negative triumphalist approach to nation-building is evident in an address he delivered to his caliphate constituency less than two weeks after independence. In it, Bello insisted vehemently that Nigeria \u201cshould be an estate of our great-grandfather, Uthman Dan Fodio.\nChief Obafemi Awolowo also articulated a rational philosophical roadmap for Nigeria. In projecting his vision of secular democracy for the country, Awolowo emphasised the pursuit of \u201c\u2026equal opportunities for every Nigerian; equality under the law; extermination of ethnic hegemony; dethronement of mediocrity wherever it exists; guaranteeing for every Nigerian no matter his place of birth or state of origin equal access to the good things of life.\nWe can succeed provided we allow ourselves to be guided by this great principle: \u2018The glory of a ruler is the welfare of every one of his people.\u2019 \u201d From the foregoing, it is evident that by amalgamating the predominantly Muslim population of northern Nigeria with the south where Christianity and western education had made tremendous impact on the various peoples there, the prospects of democracy were not encouraging. Historians of Nigerian politics tend to neglect the fact that Islam, the dominant religion of northerners, is fundamentally incompatible with democracy and human rights.\nThis point needs to be brought to limelight for a proper understanding of the challenges in entrenching viable democratic institutions and also the democratically aberrant dispositions of leading northern Muslim politicians since the creation of Nigeria as a geopolitical entity by Britain. Islam has never really favoured democratic tendencies, a fact King Fahd of Saudi Arabia frankly acknowledged some time ago when he affirmed that the democratic system is not suitable for the Muslim-dominated middle-east, that the system of free elections is not suitable for his country.\nThe political system the British met on ground in the northern region was the rustic emirate system in which politics and Islam were blended together to form a theocracy headed by the Sultan of Sokoto. In the south, particularly in the defunct eastern region sometimes misleadingly described as \u201cacephalous,\u201d most of the autochthonous communities had evolved some kind of Republican political systems anchored on key cultural groupings, whereas traditionally the Yoruba operated a kind of monarchical arrangement that had checks and balances alien to the emirate system in the north.\nNow, for members of the core northern political establishment, the democratic doctrine of separation of religion and state is a western concept which has no legitimacy in the Holy Koran and sharia law. Additionally, pious Muslims believe strongly, as a matter of religious conviction, that legitimate authority comes from Allah alone, and the ruler derives his power from Allah and the holy law, not from the people. The individual owes absolute obedience to the ruler because of the divine right of kings. Hence, a typical northern politician cannot really genuinely espouse democratic values unless he or she pays lip service to or jettisons the totalitarian principles in the Holy Koran and sharia law.\nAs devout Muslims, Ahmadu Bello and Tafawa Balewa must have felt the essential tension generated by their commitment to Islam and the need to operate according to the requirements of democratic governance in a modern nation-state. It is in this light that one can understand why, at the initial stage, they were very reluctant to embrace the concept of democracy under the umbrella of \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d and also why northern leaders regularly resorted to threats of secession during the constitutional conferences convened to fashion out an appropriate constitutional framework for post-colonial Nigeria.\nDemocracy is \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people and for the people,\u201d which means that representatives of the citizens in both the executive and the legislature derive their legitimate authority from the people, not from a certain deity believed to exist whose commands believers must obey unquestioningly.\nTherefore, although pioneer frontline Nigerian politicians inherited parliamentary democracy from Britain, that inheritance was deeply flawed partly because the British handed power over to the Northern People\u2019s Congress (NPC), whose leaders, as devout Muslims, were wedded more to the rigidities and insularity of Islamic theocracy than to the tenets of modern democracy, unlike their Christian southern counterparts whose political outlook were shaped by a deep appreciation of democratic culture and values.\nThe implications flowing from the dissonance in political consciousness between Sir Ahmadu Bello and his cohorts in the north and Dr. Azikiwe and other leading southern politicians on the democratic trajectory of post-independent Nigeria are obvious. As we observed earlier, Dr. Azikiwe and Chief Awolowo envisaged for Nigeria a democratic political system or arrangement that would cater for the welfare of all Nigerians without discrimination; but their northern counterparts were more interested in replacing external British colonialism with a pernicious internal Fulani caliphate version by subjugating the middle-belt and the south. The antagonism between these contrasting political outlooks constitute both a remote and proximate cause of the political problems that led to the eventual collapse of the First Republic.\nA plausible case can be made that British colonial administrators deliberately structured Nigeria, with the co-operation of the dominant northern political elite, to ensure that the north dominates the south after independence. That is why they configured the country lopsidedly such that the north constituted over two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s land mass. Henry Bretton in his work, Power and Stability in Nigeria: The Politics of Decolonisation, affirmed that \u201cthe very construction of the northern region, in the form in which it entered the era of independence, represents one of the greatest acts of gerrymandering in history.\u201d Naturally, the overriding intention of British imperialism for Nigeria was to protect the economic interest of Britain; it had nothing to do with the creation of a viable democratic country."}

{"prompt": "Did van Gogh cut off his ear because his brother was engaged?\nAMSTERDAM - New evidence has bolstered a theory that Vincent van Gogh's psychotic break on Dec 23, 1888, may have been set off by the news that his brother, Theo, had become engaged to be married.\nAuthor Martin Bailey writes about the findings, based on a thorough examination of family letters, in his new book, Studio Of The South: Van Gogh In Provence, which will be published on Thursday (Nov 3) in Britain.\nThe artist cut off most of his ear during a psychotic episode about 12 hours after he learned of the engagement, which is \"not something you would do if you welcomed the news, by any means\", Bailey said in a phone interview on Tuesday.\nIn the past, most scholars have credited the mental breakdown to a fight van Gogh had that same day with painter Paul Gauguin, a friend of his. Bailey believes the engagement news to be a much more significant disturbance than the fight, and said van Gogh", "baseline": "'s fears of abandonment may have been stirred.\n\"Vincent feared that he would then 'lose' Theo, his closest companion,\" Bailey wrote in the book. \"He was equally worried that his brother might withdraw the financial support which had enabled him to devote his life to art. All this was threatened by the unexpected appearance of a fianc\u00e9e.\"\nBailey, a London-based art correspondent for The Art Newspaper and an independent curator who has mounted van Gogh exhibitions at the Barbican Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Scotland/Compton Verney, previously posited his theory in an article for The Art Newspaper in 2009 and in his 2013 book The Sunflowers Are Mine: The Story Of Van Gogh's Masterpiece. But his new book provides more evidence, he said, based on an analysis of previously unpublished family correspondence.\n\"I'm even more convinced that he did indeed know about the engagement on the morning of Dec 23,\" he said.\nOther van Gogh experts are circumspect about the evidence. Ms Nienke Bakker, a curator of van Gogh paintings at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam - which owns the largest collection of the artist's works - said that it's impossible to know whether Bailey's theory is correct, because the letter that van Gogh received on Dec 23 doesn't exist any more.\n\"It might have contained the news of Theo's engagement, but this cannot be proven,\" she wrote in an email. \"It is equally possible that Theo only informed Vincent of his marriage plans when he visited his brother in hospital - thus after the ear incident.\"\nMr Sjraar van Heugten, a van Gogh expert and the author of several books about the artist, said, \"It seems fair to me that this may have played a crucial role, but it came on top of the increasingly difficult situation with Gauguin.\" He added: \"I give more weight to that, but the dramatic events were probably the result of several tensions.\"\nScholars have been puzzling over the details of van Gogh's time in Arles, in Provence, for the 126 years since the artist's death, because while he was living there from February 1888 to May 1889, he experienced both the peak of his artistic career and the beginning of his mental decline. He had his first significant psychotic breakdown there, according to a recent conference by physicians and art historians in Amsterdam earlier this year to discuss the case. It is also where he was hospitalised for the first time.\nBailey observes that, just a half day before van Gogh cut off his ear, he received a letter from Paris that may have contained the news that Theo was engaged to Johanna Bonger, known as Jo. Although he could not confirm the precise contents of that letter, which has been lost, he was able to find evidence that Bonger received a telegram of congratulations on Dec 23 from her older brother Henry - which confirmed that Henry had received the news of the engagement - shortly after receiving the announcement letter from Bonger.\nBecause Vincent and Henry were both older brothers of the betrothed parties, and had the same social standing within the family, it would seem customary to inform them both at the same time, Bailey reasons.\nEven if van Gogh had heard about the engagement on that day, however, Ms Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum said: \"The question would remain as to whether it played any part in his self-injury. It is a matter of speculation that cannot be proved one way or the other.\""}

{"prompt": "Reseller hosting businesses rent backend server space from larger companies.\n2 Can You Make Money Being a Web-hosting Reseller?\nWeb hosting companies earn money by selling server space to individuals and businesses. While some hosting companies own their own servers, many new hosting ventures begin by renting server space from another provider. This is known as \"reseller hosting.\" Typically, the larger company provides \"backend\" service that is not visible to the end user, and a reseller hosting business re-brands and sells the available server space.\nCreate a general business plan for the hosting business. Decide which market niche the hosting services will fill. For instance, some hosting companies compete by offering basic hosting at very low prices, while others offer website building services or specialized software support. Establish a list of services and prices that will be offered by the company. If many different services will be offered, split them into several different packages and pricing levels.\nDetermine what technical support options the company will offer. Around the clock customer support via phone can be attractive to customers, but requires more staff members than basic e-mail technical support. Decide if the reseller hosting business", "baseline": "will use in-house tech support personnel or if support from an outside contractor is required instead.\nForm a legal business entity for the hosting company. Choose from a sole proprietorship, limited liability company or corporation. The first option is the easiest to create, while the last two options offer better liability protection. Visit the local Secretary of State or County Clerk\u2019s office to fill out the appropriate forms for the business entity.\nSelect a backend hosting provider that offers reseller packages. Check the websites and available packages from several different companies, and find one that meets the needs of the general business plan. Compare the available storage space and bandwidth numbers from different companies. Check to see if the hosting provider will offer technical support to your end users, or if you must provide this directly. New hosting businesses usually start with a small and relatively inexpensive reseller hosting package, and expand to a larger package once the company begins to grow.\nChoose a payment processing solution for the new hosting business. Compare the costs and features of a bank merchant account, and internet-based payment processors. Verify that the payment service is able to process several different brands of credit cards, and is able to support recurring customer billing for monthly subscribers.\nCreate an internet presence for the new hosting company. Register a domain name that is unique and easy to remember. Build a website to be placed on this domain or hire a design service to create the site. Many backend hosting service providers provide customizable site templates for this purpose or offer professional design services. Present the available hosting packages and prices on the site, using the general business plan as a guide.\nMarket the new hosting business. Contact local businesses and offer the hosting services for their website; use a discounted trial rate as incentive. Network with local web design companies, freelancers and marketing companies to offer hosting to their clients. Advertise in publications such as newspapers, or using online pay-per-click advertising on search engines such as Google and Yahoo.\nMonitor and administer the reseller hosting business to prevent site downtime and keep customers satisfied. Use the backend hosting control panel to check bandwidth and storage amounts frequently and upgrade to a larger package with the hosting provider if needed. Respond quickly to customer questions or complaints, and consult with the backend hosting provider to solve any technical issues promptly.\nAries, Benjamin. \"How to Run a Reseller Hosting Company.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-reseller-hosting-company-25300.html.

{"prompt": "It recently dawned on me that it has been nearly nine long years since my wife and children moved back to India. Living on my own hasn\u2019t been easy. While mundane, everyday issues like food had understandably been the first and foremost concern, there are a myriad of things that you miss when you find yourself suddenly divested of the emotional support system that loved ones offer, especially in times of distress.\nI nearly went crazy in the beginning. Waking up on my own and getting ready for work in the deafening silence of an empty house and being greeted by a deserted, lifeless home on return had been incredibly depressing.\nI would stay up late at night as I found it impossible to sleep. My old problem of insomnia got progressively worse. If I somehow managed to doze off, I found it hard to wake up in the morning for work.\nOver time, I somehow managed to come to terms with my splendid isolation, repeatedly telling myself to pull myself together. However, without my realising it, the new \u2018bachelor\u2019 lifestyle had begun to take its emotional and physical toll on my health. I", "baseline": "really piled on the pounds as I sought to find comfort and solace in food and ate junk that Indian and Pakistani hotels usually serve.\nPerhaps you never recover from the emotional shock and sense of loss \u2013 although in my case it was supposed to have been a temporary separation. My children needed to move to attend college. They were supposed to come back soon.\nHowever, I realised shortly as well as they did that it was not going to happen anytime soon. They had not left the nest to return. Initially apprehensive and nervous, my children have come to love and enjoy the freedom, and the hustle and bustle of life back home. Now whenever they come to visit me in Dubai, they appear bored and cannot wait to go back.\nThe same goes for their mother. She is seemingly at peace with herself and enjoys the chaotic certainty of life in India, with its myriad challenges as well as small pleasures. Meanwhile, I have found myself feeling increasingly lonely and depressed, and like a stranger at home whenever I visit India.\nI have never been very social by nature. Far from it. I love my \u201cme time\u201d, as they say in the West, and like spending time with myself. I hate the company of the endlessly blabbering kind. However, even solitary, shy animals like me do miss and pine for the warmth of human company and kindred spirits. There\u2019s a void and emptiness in and around me that nothing seems to fill.\nI have tried keeping myself busy. I watch TV \u2013 indeed too much of it, I must admit. Having been a voracious, compulsive reader all my life, I know there is nothing like a good book to beat ennui and loneliness. Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience, said Mark Twain, are key to an ideal life.\nHowever, diversions like reading, TV and music may temporarily help the lonely, but they can never truly be a substitute for that priceless gift called human company, especially of those who you love. Besides, you know what Albert Einstein thought of reading after a certain age? Reading diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, said the genius.\nThere can never be \u201ctoo much\u201d reading. But, yes, it is not possible to argue with Einstein\u2019s point about being too dependent on the \u201creceived wisdom\u201d of giants like him and not thinking for ourselves. This is perhaps why the Quran repeatedly implores us to think and contemplate on the world around us, where we came from, and where we are headed.\nReturning to the issue at hand, hopelessly missing my family and wallowing in self-pity, I often wonder how my son must be dealing with his own share of blues and homesickness. He moved to the US a couple of years ago to pursue his dream of a foreign university degree.\nLiving all by himself on the other side of the world\u2013 he needs to change at least three flights from Hyderabad in India to get to his destination in the American South \u2013 the experience couldn\u2019t have been easy for him. Especially for someone as painfully shy and introverted as him.\nGrowing up, he was so emotionally attached to me that he would stand right next to me, shoulder to shoulder, even in his teens whenever we prayed together in the mosque. Now, he is all grown up to face the world on his own.\nI guess these are the rites of passage that we all must negotiate on our own. Each one of us must carry his own cross. In the words of the Quran, \u201cNo bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another\u201d. Being the protective parents that we are, we worry ourselves sick about our children, without realising that they are perhaps emotionally stronger and better equipped to deal with the world.\nCome to think of it, it is not just me who has to battle these \u201cexistential dilemmas\u201d. There are millions and millions like me in this part of the world living thousands of kilometres from home, toiling daily so their families and loved ones back home have the shot at a better life than they had.\nI know of people who have spent more than 30 to 40 years in the Gulf \u2013 more than two-thirds of their lives \u2013 and yet remain strangers in their adopted countries. Some of them arrived by ships and even by traditional dhows when the Gulf El Dorado was still in its infancy.\nMany of them spend all their lives diligently saving their dirhams and dinars, often at a great cost to themselves. They live in shared apartments, sometimes six to eight in a room, dreaming of going home \u201csoon\u201d. Many of them have missed seeing their children grow up in their crucial formative years, sharing small, everyday pleasures of life with their families. All this to ensure that their families back home live in comfort.\nIn many cases though, their hard-earned money is squandered without a thought to the sweat and blood spent in earning it. Many of these valiant soldiers die far from their loved ones and without their dreams ever being realised.\nIt is their sweat and blood that have literally built the rich petrodollar economies of the Gulf, not to mention the colossal and seldom-acknowledged contribution their remittances have made to the economies back home in South Asia and elsewhere.\nThe heaven-kissing towers and high-rises of Dubai, Doha and Jeddah wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the sheer hard work and dedication of multitudes of humble men, the overwhelming majority of them from the Subcontinent.\nThis is why I have always believed that the extraordinary lives and struggles of my fellow travellers are nothing short of a noble jihad. If jihad means striving for a noble cause and putting your life on the line for a higher purpose, then these men and women have been doing just that.\nWho says I am alone? I am surrounded by noble and selfless men and women. I am in the presence of greatness.\nThe writer is an award-winning journalist and editor."}

{"prompt": "We've spent a lot of time covering IK Multimedia's line of iOS accessories for guitarists. And with good reason: the original iRig for the iPhone and iPod Touch was one of the first dedicated music accessories for the mobile musician, helping to launch a whole cottage industry of hardware and apps that transformed iOS devices from consumption to creative devices. And with the recently released iRig Keys, IK has extended that line to keyboardists as well.\nThe iRig Keys is a 37-key mini keyboard and MIDI controller. It works as a Core MIDI device for iOS and a USB class compliant for seamless use with any app or software which supports MIDI devices on both Mac and PC. The device is complete with wheels for modulation and pitch bend and has an input jack for a sustain pedal, along with various buttons for changing octaves or volume. All of the keys are velocity-sensitive, meaning that a lighter touch will result in a softer notes while the opposite is true when hammering out chords.\nI tried out the iRig Keys on both my iPad Mini", "baseline": "and Mac. Using the Lightning adapter worked great and the Garageband App detected the keyboard, no problem. I pulled up a previous project and started playing with the pianos, organs and other MIDI instruments Garageband offers. It was a truly plug and play experience that let me focus on making music and, again, brought out the fun that Garageband is capable of. The velocity sensitivity wasn't as good as on full-sized keyboards, and certainly those with fully weighted keys, but those complaints must be taken with a grain of salt; there is plenty of variability for making expressive performances.\nIK Multimedia also publishes two great apps that serve as companions for the iRig Keys. The first is SampleTank which contains over 500 instruments over 16 categories including drum samplers, a wide range of electronic and orchestral instruments. SampleTank is free with various instrument packs unlockable with in-app purchases. The second app is the iGrand Piano, which has the most faithful piano samples I've ever heard on iOS. With pianos ranging from Classical and Grand Pianos to various uprights and even a fun Saloon piano, the app offers an incredible amount of range. Each piano is customizable with options for adjusting volume, ambience, and lid position and the automatic release of keys when not using an expression pedal are phenomenal. Both apps are compatible with the iRig Keys along with a dedicated iOS-compatible MIDI adapter called the iRig MIDI, so you can bring your own MIDI keyboard if you'd like.\nOverall, I feel that IK Multimedia has a home run on their hands with the iRig Keys and the supporting apps they've created. They're smartly designed, work well together and they sound incredible. Any keyboardist who's been jealous of all of the products out there catering to their guitarist friends finally have an equally portable solution for practicing, writing and performing.\nWired: Extremely portable and feature rich with velocity-sensitive mini keys and convenient buttons to activate features in equally rich first-party apps. Flexible use with both iOS and Mac or PC.\nTired: All plastic construction has some flex and feels a bit cheap. Unlocking the full potential of the apps is relatively costly.

In those days, the author\u2019s vices were obnoxiousness and large quantities of cocaine. Now he is sober. And the obnoxiousness has migrated, naturally, to a podcast and a Twitter feed.\nNow, at least in theory, snowflakes on", "baseline": "both coasts in withdrawal from Rachel Maddow\u2019s nightly Kremlinology lesson can purchase a whole book to inspire paroxysms of rage. \u201cWhite\u201d \u2014 even the title is a trigger \u2014 is a veritable thirst trap for the easily microaggressed.\nIt\u2019s all here.

Speaking of Black Panthers \u2014 yes, you guessed it \u2014 the author thinks that movie was insanely overhyped. It will not escape reader notice that the author of a book called \u201cWhite\u201d happens to be particularly fixated on black culture.\nEllis recently told The Times that \u201cthis is kind of a book for a Bret Easton Ellis completist.\u201d Perhaps he is right that superfans will love to hear him go on for pages about \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d being transferred from page to stage, where it closed after two months and lost $14 million.

Why head to the airport if the temperature in Scarborough is the same as the Costa Brava?\nIf we can fix the woeful public transport system and improve the road networks, we will have a chance to revive the British seaside experience which was so popular with our parents and grandparents.\nMeanwhile, bosses at Thomas Cook must be hoping that the British summer of 2019 turns out to be gloomy.

{"prompt": "Omri Barzilay is a co-founder of Propcy.\nThe real estate rental market is a highly localized, relationship-based industry driven largely by individuals living and working in their own cities, causing many to acknowledge the longstanding difficulty of streamlining disruption to this market.\nIn recent years, however, that hasn\u2019t stopped a multitude of innovators from seeking novel ways to improve the process\u2019s efficiency.\nIf early innovators like Zillow and Trulia primarily entailed bringing real estate data online, newer innovators harness data not only to improve analytics for landlords, but also to improve efficiency for apartment seekers. This becomes more important as New York City, for instance, begins to see the start of an expected surge in rental apartments \u2014 more than 38,000 market-rate rental apartments, mostly in Brooklyn and Queens, are expected to be completed over the next three years.\nWith the advent of new technologies, the market has begun to shift nearly every aspect of the rental process, from leasing applications to communications with landlords and agents to payment processing.\nAs rentals become commod", "baseline": "itized and fewer people are satisfied being tied down to static assets, a number of players have sought to empower potential renters in new ways. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is enabling rental without a broker. New York-based real estate startup Oliver, for example, launched in 2015 to serve as a platform that cuts out the middleman and seamlessly connects renters with apartments.\nWhat this means in practice is that by aggregating real-time rental inventory directly from property managers and landlords, rather than through third-parties, the Oliver app enables renters not only to browse and filter listings as could be done on other platforms, but also to schedule showings at the tap of a button using an in-app calendar feature. Rezi, an earlier-stage New York startup, also saves time by automatically scheduling multiple apartment visits to fit its users\u2019 schedules.\nOthers have invested resources in improving the process for brokers themselves. Nestio, a residential leasing and marketing platform, streamlines the leasing process using cloud-based software, which enables listings to be shared, leads to be tracked and clients to be managed in one easy-to-use platform.\nAn increasing number of startups, both small and large, are empowering renters.\nEarlier this year, Naked Apartments, a website that optimizes how brokers can proactively approach potential and current clients with appropriate, targeted listings, became Zillow\u2019s fifth consumer-brand acquisition, with the shared goal of using data analytics to bring transparency to New York\u2019s real estate landscape for brokers.\nAs agents spend less time at their desk and more time closing on rental deals via mobile applications, DotLoop has also focused on automating more redundant tasks by allowing agents to upload important documents, negotiate transactions and get bank-approved e-signatures in a single platform.\nOthers are playing matchmaker in different ways: by connecting potential roommates to each other. Roomi, which raised $4 million in seed funding led by DCM Ventures and already boasts more than 375,000 users in North America, as well as smaller market players like EasyRoommate, make it simpler for renters to find and connect with compatible roommates, whether renting an extra room in an apartment or searching together for an apartment.\nOther startups are seeking to disrupt the traditional corporate housing and long-term stay marketplace. Startups like HomeSuite, an online marketplace that removes the hassle from finding furnished housing, aggregates not just long-term but also short-term inventory, geared toward individuals who might previously have focused their searches on more standard month-to-month property managers. In doing so, they are filling the grey area between Craigslist and Airbnb, serving the needs of individuals looking for something more permanent than a vacation rental yet more transient than a typically longer lease commitment.\nDisruption hasn\u2019t been limited to the search process. Even payment solutions and mobile are being integrated into newer platforms by companies like RadPad, an end-to-end photo-based rental marketplace aiming to become an A-to-Z platform for renters and landlords alike.\nRentPayment similarly reduces the hassle of paper checks and improves the rent payment and collection process by serving as a platform for renters to pay their leases directly to their property managers by credit card, debit card or e-check.\nAs lead-generation platforms begin to focus more on empowering with complex data analytics those involved in the rental process, an increasing number of startups, both small and large, are empowering renters with more flexible co-living options, capitalizing on the trends toward both optimized roommate matching and pre-furnished apartments.\nWeWork, the international co-working startup valued upwards of $16 billion as of March 2016, announced in January that it has begun to convert some of its spaces into fully furnished, flexible apartments. \u201cWeLive replicates the security and comfort of a suburban neighborhood, but with the energy and vigor of a major city,\u201d said the company in a statement, highlighting the company\u2019s strategy to provide residents with private and semi-private housing accommodations alongside community events like fitness classes and potluck dinners, as well as a digital social network. Common, another co-living startup, also offers what it calls \u201cflexible, community-driven housing,\u201d and, in doing so, is revolutionizing the way apartment rental is traditionally done.\nAs more user-friendly startups begin to steal market share from Craigslist, the value of disruptive innovation that reduces rental-market opacity has become ever clearer, and speaks to the expectations that renters, agents and landlords now have around enabling the rental process, primarily offline in years past, with new technologies. Even more incremental changes, from video walk-throughs to new ways of slicing community rental data, have begun to play significant roles as startups cram into the real estate market, hoping for even a small slice of a huge pie."}
{"prompt": "Aside from its thematic strengths and its delightful characters, if there\u2019s one thing Steven Universe is known for, it\u2019s having a killer soundtrack, jam-packed with powerful, toe-tapping songs.

{"prompt": "Update | 11:08 p.m. Read an article by Steve Lohr on keeping abreast of innovation in the Continuing Education special section.\nNoah Berger for The New York Times Tyler Kennedy, 9, searches the Web at home in California.\nThe report examined the comparative research on online versus traditional classroom teaching from 1996 to 2008. Some of it was in K-12 settings, but most of the comparative studies were done in colleges and adult continuing-education programs of various kinds, from medical training to the military.\nOver the 12-year span, the report found 99 studies in which there were quantitative comparisons of online and classroom performance for the same courses. The analysis for the Department of Education found that, on average, students doing some or all of the course online would rank in the 59th percentile in tested performance, compared with the average classroom student scoring in the 50th percentile. That is a modest but statistically meaningful difference.\n\u201cThe study\u2019s major significance lies in demonstrating that online learning today is not just better than", "baseline": "nothing \u2014 it actually tends to be better than conventional instruction,\u201d said Barbara Means, the study\u2019s lead author and an educational psychologist at SRI International.\nThis hardly means that we\u2019ll be saying good-bye to classrooms. But the report does suggest that online education could be set to expand sharply over the next few years, as evidence mounts of its value.\nUntil fairly recently, online education amounted to little more than electronic versions of the old-line correspondence courses. That has really changed with arrival of Web-based video, instant messaging and collaboration tools.\nThe real promise of online education, experts say, is providing learning experiences that are more tailored to individual students than is possible in classrooms. That enables more \u201clearning by doing,\u201d which many students find more engaging and useful.\n\u201cWe are at an inflection point in online education,\u201d said Philip R. Regier, the dean of Arizona State University\u2019s Online and Extended Campus program.\nThe biggest near-term growth, Mr. Regier predicts, will be in continuing education programs. Today, Arizona State has 5,000 students in its continuing education programs, both through in-person classes and online. In three to five years, he estimates, that number could triple, with nearly all the growth coming online.\nBut Mr. Regier also thinks online education will continue to make further inroads in transforming college campuses as well. Universities \u2014 and many K-12 schools \u2014 now widely use online learning management systems, like Blackboard or the open-source Moodle. But that is mostly for posting assignments, reading lists, and class schedules and hosting some Web discussion boards.\nMr. Regier sees things evolving fairly rapidly, accelerated by the increasing use of social networking technology. More and more, students will help and teach each other, he said. For example, it will be assumed that college students know the basics of calculus, and the classroom time will focus on applying the math to real-world problems \u2014 perhaps in exploring the physics of climate change or modeling trends in stock prices, he said.\nFor K-12, online classes may translate to more face-to-face instruction. We pulled our son out of a useless junior high, let him play guitar and video games at home all day, and used an online charter school to teach him ourselves at night. The online curriuculum was definitely superior to what the local school offered, and the 1:1 instruction was very efficient. After one semester, he\u2019s ahead of all his old classmates, rather than failing, and he\u2019s enjoying life. Most people probably can\u2019t arrange their lives to do this, but it sure can work when it works.\nIf you resonate with the studies conclusions, consider that we\u2019ve only begun to scratch the surface. Imagine what we\u2019ll begin to see when the generation that\u2019s been \u201cbathed in bits\u201d begins building learning communities?\nImagine a mash-up of stumbleupon (randomizing), plus freerice.com (rewards/incentives), plus websites only slightly tweaked to deliver the core content required by states\u2019 NCLB-mandated standards. The most successful (digital) charter school in history.\nGreat to see the validation from SRI.\nLearning is an independent activity Mr. Reiger to the contrary\u2026 We all decide what we want to learn \u2014 1st decision and then for different people there are different ways to learn things\u2026 The computer which can repreat things forever \u2014 and is very patient is a good method for that reason\u2026 It can also talk to us and put up something for us to read concurrently \u2014 this is where much teaching falls down \u2014 on the visual component..A few things do need hands on practice.. say dissection but having had lots of trouble with the instruction from the human instructor on the dissection of the baby pig \u2013 I now wonder how I would have done with computer directions to guide me\u2026. sort of like operating long distance via video hookups which are now done\u2026..\nand thank heavesn for Wikipedia. \u2014 there are some good people out there.\nOne problem with saying that students in online classes do slightly better than students in traditional classes goes back to the old comparing apples and oranges thing. Online classes have their own assessments that may not parallel traditional assessments. The very technology tends to skew what can and cannot be assessed. Was there any standardization in the compared assessments, I wonder?\nI\u2019m halfway through an online master\u2019s program with SJSU\u2019s SLIS. It\u2019s incredibly individualist, timely, and convenient. While the difference between an instructor that can effectively utilize the technology and also bridge the gap of disconnect between students and one who cannot is literally the difference between day and night, I think that the future of education is not as \u201cscary\u201d as it used to be.\np.s. I assure you Hetty, that it costs much more than you think to run these types of programs well.\nI wonder to what degree the comparisons are skewed because online learners tend to have more access to technology etc in general. There could be a real effect, but dubious about the magnitude.\nIsn\u2019t it a self-selecting group that would want to learn online? Could this be a reason why those taking online courses do better? There\u2019s a certain drive and motivation necessary to force yourself to learn something you don\u2019t have to.\nPerhaps by giving business, civics, math and the sciences over to online learning, truly significant time in the classroom can be given over to the arts and humanities.\nFascinating. When it came to college instruction, did the study consider whether older learners did better than traditional college students?\nIn my experience, on-line learning can work with motivated adults who already possess the BA or BS and take on-line classes to get a credential or a salary boost at work.\nTraditional-age college students need the classroom interaction. For that matter, college-level learning is NOT an individual experience. It\u2019s totally dependent upon dialogue and discussion. Otherwise, we might as well say that all we ever need to know we can get by gazing at our navels.\nI\u2019m very disturbed by Hetty Greene\u2019s comment. Wikipedia may provide answers, but a college education is designed to help people ask questions and to analyze. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it does not teach analytical or critical thinking. If you don\u2019t want those things, don\u2019t go to college. And if you want a good lawyer, you best make sure he or she does not see the world in terms of answers and quick facts rather than in terms of questions and analysis.\nCollege students, especially those aged 18-24, need to be challenged by the professor and fellow students in person, because they are far too sheltered and naive to seek challenges to what they already think to be true. Those over the age of 24 are not much better, but if they\u2019ve already gone to college they know to ask questions. Young people, now raised in Hetty Greene\u2019s world in which answers and not questions are touted as the end all and be all, are especially in need of the critical thinking skills that a college education provides.\nFor that matter, most of my on-line students failed their courses and the university knew they\u2019d fail. On-line courses are cash cows *designed* to take advantage of irresponsible, parent-shielded child-adults who, while by no means dumb, are too lazy to drop courses in which they lose interest. Students in my classroom rarely fail because they stop attending class. Students on-line, however, quickly lose interest and are so enamored of their new independence that they forget to drop the course. The F stays on their record and the university gets the cash.\nI have personally been the student in a variety of settings, including online, traditional college, foreign universities, community college, etc. What I have found is 1 year later, my retention rate of the material I learned is about the same, irrespective of the delivery method.\nThat said, I found the online learning drudgery. No live interaction with students & teachers, no debates, etc. No camaraderie, no life-long friendships formed, etc. Not good for extroverts. Living on campus with fellow students is more valuable, and leaves greater impressions, than what you learn in the classroom, particularly 30 years later. So for young people, I definitely recommend the college campus experience, living away from home starting at 18. What you learn about life & getting along with other people will never be reproduced online.\nOn the plus side, driving to class after work to listen to a bored adjunct for 90 minutes, then driving home is a waste of time. I could read that material myself in 20 minutes in the comfort of my home AND get a higher score on the test. You can move at your own speed and don\u2019t waste time doing stuff that\u2019s redundant. You can do assignments at 2 a.m. if you want \u2013 it\u2019s your schedule. In these regards, online learning is superior. Much better for working stiffs trying to get ahead.\nThe subject matter is also important. Much easier to learn computer programming online than brain surgery. Anything involving people, like physical therapy, needs a large \u201clive\u201d component. OTH, accounting can likely be done easily online.\nBottom line is the motivated learner or student can do well in a variety of settings. As #3 pointed out, it\u2019s cheaper to do online. Just record the professor\u2019s lecture one time, and you\u2019re done, even if s/he dies.\nIt\u2019s also good for people who live in Timbuktu. You can still have access to the famous professor from home, something that was impossible before.\nFrom this overview that has been presented, it would appear that the research has discovered a correlation rather than a causation in their results.\nMore bluntly, people taking online courses are a self selected group of people who want to learn. In a regular college environment, that just isn\u2019t there \u2013 there are plenty of deadbeats who get weeded out, or people who realize that this isn\u2019t for them, or people who were pushed into college by mom and dad and just aren\u2019t too terribly bright.\nComparison of test scores doesn\u2019t validate the results that Ms. Means and her team has drawn from their research. Their results are interesting, but the essential point still stands; they\u2019ll need more data on the students themselves to draw any form of conclusion about the real efficacy of online teaching.\nJust throwing online tools at people does not mean they will engage in meaningful learning. And many course management systems \u2014 Blackboard is the notorious biggest offender \u2014 are closed, proprietary, and their online media are decades behind the curve.\nIt\u2019s free and open source software and all the curricular materials are free for others to use.\nYes, I strongly agree. As a teacher, I want students to have individualized learning experiences, especially students who are already 2-3 years behind.\nRight now in Florida we actually have a state law that says students who have already been retained \u201c2 or more years\u201d in public schools are required to be in an \u201calternative placement\u201d \u2014 but no one bothered to fund any alternative placement settings for those students already left back 2 or more years who are not eligible for special ed because they do not score low enough to qualify.\nWhat these kids need is an online alternative placement classroom; one like the online classrooms now being used in NYC over the summer to teach math as recently profiled in the NY Times.\nBy offering students an online alternative, in school, the school still gets the money to educate the student, and the student has a chance for an individual online experience that may even enable the student to catch up.\nAnd, the student could still attend music, art and PE classes with their actual age peers, which is not what happens now.\nThis is not a good situation for that student, or for the other students who are actually only 10 years old.\nAnd the larger student does not like taking 4th grade art, music and PE three years in a row either.\nSo, I am looking forward to more online learning in schools, especially for situations like the above. This would really be a tremendous help to all students and teachers.\nWhile enrolled in a mixed media course, where lectures were delivered online through Blackboard with weekly discussion/quiz sessions in a classroom, we quickly found that the best way for many of us to watch the lectures was, in fact, together. This gave everyone a chance to ask questions in the middle of the lecture, and have a possible answer. However, having the ability to go straight to lectures during review helped in studying for finals, or doing homework. Nonetheless, given the complex content of the course, I feel that at least some human interaction was necessary for conceptual comprehension.\nOn the contrary, Buzz, I think most people can rearrange their lives to allow their kids the best education. There\u2019s no law, biological or otherwise, that says kids can only learn between 9 and 3 or between September and June. Teenagers in particular are more awake in the afternoon and evening than they are at 7am. Why not allow them to adjust their educational schedule to fit their circadian rhythm by implementing more asynchronous learning?\nBeing in a doctorate program at Boston University, I can certainly attest to the rigor and depth of the educational experience. I have degrees and certification from several prominent institutions (Kenyon College, University of Colorado \u2013 Boulder, University of TN \u2013 Knoxville, University of Memphis), and would put my on-line experience at BU against any of my excellent live classroom experiences. Being able to continue to work while attending graduate school has been a major plus. I am able to remain in my house, no travel time, and can archive lectures and classes.\nOn the down side, one misses the informal exchanges of student-to-student and student to faculty personal contacts.\nI agree with the last paragraph completely. I have studied in online only, classroom only, and an online/classroom hybrid. While I learned a lot from all of them, logic in online classes and political science and all the drama that entails in classroom classes, I did like the hybrids. Sharing thoughts online and then meeting in person.\nI completed an accredited online graduate course in the Humanities at the age is 83! Independent study is the way we all learn, and through the graded discussions and a good professor, it is the only way of the future for working people who cannot travel for their studies, and saves the enormous expense of dormitory life.\nIt is truly astounding that schools do not offer more online courses..\nJS17 seems to have more varied experiences than I have; and seems to capture several facets of the argument. I think certain subjects and basic disciplines could be taught on-line; but others wouldn\u2019t lend themselves to it. Hetty Green thinks one could become a lawyer for $100. Good luck with that. How is one going to participate in a Socratic dialogue amongst ones peers? Maybe when videoconferencing improves and becomes cheaper.\nI wonder if what could also be happening, with regards to college students participating in online courses, is that those people voluntarily taking these courses are self-selected to be students with more tenacity and self-discipline than students who would not be able to make that commitment. Just a thought. I could be way off-base here.\nMath *is* a humanity. It is not a science. It is an art in itself, not a tool, although it can be used as a tool, much as the English language can be used as a tool though it is not *merely* a tool.\nAnd the best way to learn it is through wide ranging mathematical conversation with an actual mathematician, as opposed to \u201cproblem sets\u201d. Unfortunately there is little to no math (proofs, methods of proof etc), and next to no mathematicians, below university level in this country so most people are not exposed to this fact.. Perhaps an inherent flaw of forced \u201ceducation\u201d.\nAs to the original article, I suspect again that, because correllation is not equal to causation, there is quite a bit of self-selection in the study. Whether this be true or not, however, the lower cost of online instruction will drive increased use of online education systems in the future.\nanimation clips, virtual field trips, QTVRs, sound clips to help convey information and concepts.

{"prompt": "The Public Service Commission on Wednesday approved a pilot program intended to create up to 350 megawatts of long-term renewable power within the next three years, a move that state officials and environmentalists say could help establish a permanent guideline that utilities would use to generate or purchase electricity from renewable sources.\nThe decision, which followed an eight-hour meeting in Covington, comes four months after the commission announced its support for the program, which is aimed at bolstering the Louisiana's fuel mix while adding resources that contribute to its reliable and economic long-term power supply.\nFor years, state officials have considered creating a renewable portfolio standard that would require regulated electricity utilities to acquire a portion of their energy from generators that use renewable sources. Some environmentalists and renewable energy advocates say the pilot program that has been approved will also encourage growth and potentially fast-track testing of smaller-scale renewable sources, which would then be sold to in-state utilities.\nDetails of the program were released for public comment in August, and based on the feedback that was received, state officials made several changes to its guidelines, including one that allows some", "baseline": "woody biomass products to be turned into fuel.\nThe program is intended to create enough long-term renewable power supply 2 percent of the state's energy needs, by way of a request for proposals that would spur research and development of renewable energy technologies, such as biomass, geothermal, hydro, solar or wind.\nThe board met in executive session for a half-hour before returning to vote on the pilot program, with commissioners indicating that talk centered on opening the program to out-of-state resources.\nDiscussion on the pilot program, nearing the end of the day, drew a back-and-forth dialogue between Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, the lone vote against the proposal and the most vocal member of the Public Service Commission at the meeting, and several of his colleagues.\n\"In the future, who knows what will happen,\" said Skrmetta, of Metairie, who took issue with the program, set to run over several years, being considered an experimental trial. \"I don't think it's a pilot, I don't think it passes the smell test on being a pilot for me, and I think it's the wrong way to go.\"\nOther commissioners, including the board's chairman, Lambert Boissiere III of New Orleans, said the program, while not perfect, should move forward.\nAfter the meeting, Jordan Macha, a conservation organizer for the state chapter of the Sierra Club, praised the pilot program as an important step in putting Louisiana in the company of other states attempting to move away from fossil fuels in producing electricity.\n\"With anything of this magnitude, the devil's in the details,\" Macha said.\nMeanwhile, a day after New Orleans-based power provider Entergy Corp. said that the company was cooperating with a Justice Department investigation into its competitive practices, several commissioners, including Lambert and Foster Campbell, said they believed Entergy should have provided details about the inquiry in the weeks since the probe began.\n\"I'm real concerned about it,\" said Campbell, of Elm Grove, who added: \"We need to be up to date about this investigation, exactly what's involved. I hope it's nothing bad, but I'd like to know everything about it.\""}
{"prompt": "What do Indy Mayor Joe Hogsett and Manual student have in common?\nJose Bravo was dressed neatly in a suit as he rode up the elevator to the 25th floor of the City-County Building. The 17-year-old was about to meet Mayor Joe Hogsett, and he wasn't sure what to expect.\nNo need to worry. The incoming senior at Manual High School and the mayor hit it off immediately. They bonded over a shared love of lifeguarding, football and Netflix.\n\"I was nervous before this, but he's like a friend,\" Bravo said. \"We're a lot alike.\"\nThe teen is the Boys & Girls Club of Indianapolis youth of the year, and Hogsett was serving as a mentor for the day. The same thing was supposed to be happening across the city for 200 other teens, but the push for volunteers for this year's Take a Boy/Girl to Work Day came up significantly short, said club director Rick Whitten.\nHogsett agreed to keep his commitment to host Bravo at his office Wednesday as a way to encourage", "baseline": "others to step up to volunteer. A new date for the citywide initiative has not been set.\n\"If more people would take the time to mentor young people in our city, I don't think there's any question that would be transformative,\" Hogsett said. \"I think our community would be invaluably enriched. Jose is the mentor of tomorrow.\"\nAfter a tour of the city-county offices, Bravo and Hogsett sat down to a lunch of sandwiches and chips in the mayor's conference room. They talked about college, family and how the Boys & Girls Club shaped them.\nBravo has been a member of the Keenan-Stahl Boys & Girls Club, 1949 E. Troy Ave., for 10 years. He works at the club after school and is a lifeguard in the summer.\nHogsett, 60, grew up in Rushville, where he was active in the Boys Club and worked seven years as a lifeguard and manager at the city pool.\n\"He is me 43 years ago,\" the mayor said. \"I got started at the Boys Club, much like Jose has done. I worked my way up to junior leader, refereed ball games, coached sports teams.\"\nThe clubs have a \"profound\" impact on the quality of life for children in neighborhoods served by them, he said. There are 11 Boys & Girls Clubs in Indianapolis.\nBravo asked Hogsett about his efforts to get guns off the streets, just as news of another double-fatality shooting was breaking on the city's north side.\nAs U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, Hogsett said he took an aggressive approach to fighting violent crime but acknowledged the serious challenges the city faces when it comes to gun violence. \"We're doing all we can.\"\nHe then asked the teen if he watches Channel 16, the public access channel where government meetings can be viewed. Bravo politely said, \"when I can,\" while Hogsett's communications director Taylor Schaffer laughed out loud and said, \"No one watches it except you, sir; he's just being polite.\"\nHogsett admitted he is glued to Channel 16. That and Netflix, which he just discovered last fall.\nWhen Bravo asked what the mayor watches, Hogsett ticked off his favorite shows: \"House of Cards,\" \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"GLOW,\" \"13 Reasons Why\" and \"Bloodline.\"\n\"I think if I was the mayor, I wouldn't have time to watch Netflix,\" Bravo said, more as a question than anything.\n\"I binge-watch, six or seven hours at at time\" on the weekend, Hogsett told him. \"When I watched the first season of 'House of Cards,' I thought it was over the top, unbelievable. But with what is going on in Washington today, it's like reality TV.\"\nWhen Bravo said he would probably start watching it, Hogsett laughed and said, \"You shouldn't, you're too young.\"\nBefore the two headed off to a news conference, Hogsett promised to come to one of Manual's football games in the fall, where Bravo is a linebacker. The teen hopes to attend Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to study business and communications and plans to be a mentor himself.\nLater, Whitten said the mayor served as a great example for the teen. \"We hope to encourage lots of local professionals to volunteer for a day of mentorship.\"\nTo learn more, call (317) 313-8411 or email lharris@bgcindy.org."}
{"prompt": "Heath Herring is a colorful personality in the world of mixed martial arts, known for his Dennis Rodman-esque hairstyles, entertaining fights and a New Years Eve kiss in 2005 from an unlikely person \u0096 his opponent Yoshihiro Nakao. Though he grew up in Amarillo, Texas, Herring has traveled the world fighting in promotions such as Pride and K-1. Herring will return to his home state April 7 to fight Brad Imes in a heavyweight matchup at UFC 69 in Houston.\nI spent 20 minutes talking to Herring by phone on March 27. We discussed his UFC debut earlier this year -- a stunning loss to Jake O'Brien at UFC Fight Night 8 -- his upcoming match against Imes, and the news that the UFC owners had just purchased Pride.\nUFC Fight Night 8You lost a fairly one-sided decision to O'Brien at UFC Fight Night 8 on Jan. 25. That was your debut fight with the promotion and you were brought in with a lot of fanfare", "baseline": ". Why do you think you lost the fight?\nI think I learned a lot at that fight. I had to realize that the UFC isn't the same organization as what I was used to fighting [for] in Japan. And the end result was that I came up short on the judges' cards. And that's what happens sometimes. You start playing a new game with little bit different rules -- sometimes those new rules will kind of catch ya.\nWhen you say new rules, what is different about the UFC compared to Pride?\nJust a lot of minor differences, I would say. Like the referee standing the fight up at different times. I think here in the states, they put a lot of credit on [what happens] once the fighters hit the ground, even if there's not a lot of action being done. I think they let the fight continue on the ground for a long time. As opposed to Japan, [where] I've been in fights where we were on the ground 10, 15 seconds [and] they'd stand us up.\nBut, I'm by no means trying to put that blame on the referee or anything else. That's absolutely my ignorance and that's why I'm taking full responsibility for that fight.\nIn hindsight, how do you feel about that performance?\nwin and like I said afterward, I like to give the fans what they want -- that's an exciting fight. I look at it as my job to be in shape and be able to go the full 15 minutes, as hard as I can. And if you get caught with a punch or get caught with a cut or something like that, that's part of it. But to lose to a guy who wasn't doing a whole lot and he was picking away the points -- yeah, that sat a little bit badly with me. But, you're going to be a little bit smarter next time and learn how things go.\nAfter your loss to O'Brien, you mentioned you had an MCL injury. First, which MCL was it?\nI think there was some stuff that did come out but I never officially came out and said either way.\nAbout the injuries, I sure hate when people make excuses about fights. And just to sum it up real quick, I went in there and I knew what the score was when I got in the fight and I still chose to get in there so I'm not going to sit back and make up an excuse for an injury. I hate when guys to do that.\nIf you read stuff -- and I'm not saying it wasn't so and it didn't happen -- but I sure hate to make that as an excuse for why I had such a poor performance.\nAre you completely healed from that injury as you prepare for UFC 69?\nYes sir. If I'm getting in the ring, [then] I'm healing up. I am feeling really, really good on it. I'm able to kick again and everything so it's [a lot] better than it was.\nI noticed that when you entered the Octagon, you puffed on an inhaler. I haven't noticed too many fighters doing this, at least not right before entering the Octagon. Is this something you do before every fight?\nYes sir. I've actually had asthma since I was a child. I think it might be a little bit more psychosomatic than anything. I can't even tell you the last time I really had to take a puff on an inhaler but I kind of just do it right before the fight more out of habit than anything. I've been fighting for 10 years and there was a time when I used to have to [use] a breathing machine before I'd fight. I'm real fortunate now that I'm able to really not have too much of a problem with my asthma. That's more of a preventative measure.\nYou also mentioned after the O'Brien fight that you wanted to give the fans excitement and you seemed to imply that wrestling doesn't deliver this excitement.\nThe point I was trying to stress was, we were in there for a fight. I don't feel I'm out of line to interpret my opponent's actions as he was taking me down, kind of just holding me down, and not doing a whole lot.\nThat was more me venting my frustration.\nEven on the ground, I think I threw more punches than he did [and] I was on my back. I was out there trying to finish the fight and I can't necessarily say the same thing about my opponent. I think he was trying to survive the fight and win on points, which is a valid strategy and obviously he won that fight. Like I said before, that was something I've had to go in and re-analyze and understand that's part of the game.\nDo you consider ground skills and takedown defense a strong part of your game?\nNormally, my ground skills are actually very, very good. And if anybody has a history of my fights, I do have very good ground skills and very good ground defense.\nUnfortunately, I was unable to show those at the athletic level I normally have this last fight.\nFor those who may not be familiar with your fights, how would you describe your fighting style?\n[Laughing] Normally? Normally, it's a very fast paced style -- I do a lot of kicking, a lot of punching. And I'm looking to end the fight on the ground [or] standing up. I've actually won probably the majority of my fights by submission, believe it or not. I'm always looking for that finish. I was a mainstay in Japan for a lot of years because I think a lot of the fans over there realized that there was always something to watch with me. I was always an exciting fighter. I wasn't known for these long, drawn out, boring fights that unfortunately sometimes seem to pepper through this sport.\nUFC 69You've traveled the world, fighting in Pride and K-1. How does it feel to now be fighting in Houston in UFC 69, near where you grew up in Amarillo, Texas?\nI'm really excited about it. I'm glad to be fighting back in my home state of Texas. It's also double-edged because it's going to be the first UFC ever in Texas and I think the fans are really, really looking forward to that. When I got the opportunity to fight on that card, I accepted right away. And I knew it was something that would be important for me to be on and be a part of.\nHouston's real far away from Amarillo but considering all the places I've been on God's green earth, it's not too far away from where I grew up. [laughing] So, I'm looking forward to it.\nYour opponent in UFC 69 -- Imes -- is a former TUF fighter who is a little taller and a little heavier than you and is also a grappler like O'Brien. What else do you know about Imes as a fighter?\nWell, to be honest with you, I don't really see him as being much of a grappler. I think he's going to come out and try to punch a lot more. But, he might surprise me. I think he's more of a stand-up kind of guy -- he likes to throw a lot of punches and do a few kicks. I know he trains with Tim Sylvia -- he's one of Sylvia's sparring partners and he comes from the Miletich fight camp.\nSo, we are looking for him to come out there and give me a good fight. And I think it'll be an exciting fight. He'll also be fighting in front of a hometown crowd as well.\nHow do you feel you will match up against him?\nI feel I match up very good against him. I'm actually really excited about this fight. I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to get out there and showcase what our skills and abilities are to the fans.\nIt's a chance for me to get a little bit of vindication after that last disappointment. [laughing] And it is for him as well. So, it's actually a good fight for both of us.\nGiven that you lost your first fight in the UFC, do you feel you are at a crossroads in your UFC career with this upcoming match?\nYou could interpret that in many ways. I've had several people ask me that question. I think if I sat down and I really let the pressure get to me, it could. But, I just have to trust in my abilities, where I've been, what I've been through. I know what I've gone through. I know all the opponents that I've faced. And I know what my abilities are. So, I'm really not too worried about it. I know I've got a place in the sport for a long time to come. Unfortunately, I feel that people weren't able to see me fight at the top of my abilities at that last fight. So, I need to come out and show everybody what I am capable of as opposed to seeing half of a performance.\nIf you do defeat Imes, who would you like to fight next?\nI've never even considered opponents to be honest with you. In Japan, that was a favorite question of all the interviewers. And I never really had a good answer for them. Whoever the organization offers up to me at the time, I'm going to take and accept. I like to stay active. I like to stay busy obviously. I just fought. I'm trying to fight again. I've had a year, year-and-a-half layoff due to some legal issues in Japan so I'm actually glad to be back in the swing of things.\nSo, as far as an opponent that I would want to face, probably the quickest fight that they'll give me after this one -- if everything goes the way I want it to -- then I'll probably say yes to [that matchup].\nYou're known for interesting haircuts and hair dye jobs. Do you have a special haircut that you have planned for this fight, your return to Texas?\nYou know what, I'm going to talk to the girl that does it. I have a girl here in Vegas -- her name's Valerie -- she's the one that does my hair. If you saw me right now, my hair's long, I've got a long beard. I just grow everything out and then I go in the week of the fight and give her free reign to do whatever she wants. I think it's a little bit like artistic freedom. I think if you're someone doing that everyday -- day in and day out -- you don't get many opportunities [where] someone just comes in and says \"Do whatever you want\"\nUsually I'm pretty open with the people who do it and they've always done a really, really good job. In Holland, I had a different guy who used to do my hair. I think they really enjoyed it. This time I might try to sway her a little bit and see if she's got something planned just for Texas. But, I think when you have an open and creative license with things, sometimes you do your best work.\nPre-UFC CareerWhy did you leave Pride at the end of 2004?\nUnfortunately I was being managed by someone who I thought was looking out for my best interest and they decided it would be better for me to move over to K-1.\nWe had a little bit of differences with K-1. Then I was forced to be in legal limbo until my contract came up as of last year.\nAs you mentioned, after you left Pride, you went to K-1. When you fought in K-1, you were part of a memorable occurrence Dec. 31, 2005. During the pre-fight staredown, your opponent, Nakao, leaned in and kissed you on the lips. You retaliated by punching him and the fight was eventually ruled a no-contest. Has Nakao ever explained why he did what he did?\nSo, neither he nor anyone else in his camp has ever apologized for the kiss?\nDo you regret reacting to that kiss with a punch -- would you have rather taken it out on him during the fight?\nNo. In hindsight, I think that's the reason that image has become so popular among people. I think people like to think that under the circumstances they would have done the same thing. And I think sometimes it's kind of hard not to be uncompromising.\nI think he learned his lesson. I don't think he's been doing that again, so I think that's a good thing.\nAs you mentioned, the video footage of that kiss has become pretty famous and UFC used footage of that kiss to promote your entry into the UFC. Were you OK with UFC doing that?\nAbsolutely, I had no problem with it. And actually, to speak kindly of K-1, they let us use that image, very kindly, without any problems.\nEverything seems to be clicking together now finally and if we start winning some fights, there won't be a problem. That's the most important thing.\nHow would you compare UFC as an organization to Pride as you knew it back then and K-1?\nWell, if you're going to do a comparison, I don't know if anybody who's ever traveled overseas or been in Japan -- you have to get used to that cultural difference. There's a significant cultural difference. [I'm] not saying if it's good or bad, it's just a difference -- you have to learn how to deal with it.\nAlso, I would say me having a little condo out here in Vegas for my training purposes, it's been really easy to be able to drive down and take care of things with the UFC people here.\nI can't say necessarily that I like one better. People in the UFC have treated me like gold and I've got nothing but a lot of good words to say about them. Same with the people in Pride. And I won't say anything bad about the people in K-1 either. There were a lot of good people in K-1. Just because we had a couple of contractual differences doesn't mean that the organization as a whole wasn't a good organization.\nAnd as someone who has fought in both Pride and UFC, what are your thoughts on the news that the owners of UFC \u0096 Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta -- are buying Pride?\nI don't know. Mixed feelings. I think the Fertittas have done a great job with UFC here in the states. They've helped the sport really grow. As somebody who competes and loves the sport -- as an athlete in it -- I'm hoping it's not going to be a bad thing. I think it's going to be a good thing. I'm just going to keep my fingers crossed.\nHow many fights do you have left on your UFC contract?\nAfter this one, I'll have three.\nSo you signed a five-fight contract with them?\nPramit Mohapatra covers mixed martial arts for baltimoresun.com.

Clashes began Wednesday evening and lasted through Thursday night. Police are on alert to prevent further provocations or acts of vengeance.\nThe day of violence began Wednesday evening, just after the start of the Yom Kippur fast, when an Arab driver from Akko's Old City entered a majority-Jewish neighborhood at high-speed.

Jews from the neighborhood gathered and the driver took refuge with his relatives, a local Arab family.\nAt that point, Akko Arabs were called to come to the aid of the driver and his family, with the help of a rumor that Jews had killed an Arab resident of the Old City.

The Arabs began vandalizing Jewish-owned cars in the street and smashing windows. Afterwards, we saw them coming with axes and slashing tires. It was awful.

{"prompt": "Earth requires fuel to drive plate tectonics, volcanoes and its magnetic field. Like a hybrid car, Earth taps two sources of energy to run its engine: primordial energy from assembling the planet and nuclear energy from the heat produced during natural radioactive decay. Scientists have developed numerous models to predict how much fuel remains inside Earth to drive its engines -- and estimates vary widely -- but the true amount remains unknown. In a new paper, a team of geologists and neutrino physicists boldly claims it will be able to determine by 2025 how much nuclear fuel and radioactive power remain in the Earth's tank. The study, authored by scientists from the University of Maryland, Charles University in Prague and the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, was published on September 9, 2016, in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.\n\"I am one of those scientists who has created a compositional model of the Earth and predicted the amount of fuel inside Earth today,\" said one of the study's authors William McDonough, a professor of geology at the University of Maryland. \"We're in a field of guesses.

Inside the detector, scientists detect antineutrinos when they crash into a hydrogen atom. The collision produces two characteristic light flashes that unequivocally announce the event. The number of events scientists detect relates directly to the number of atoms of uranium and thorium inside the Earth. And the decay of these elements, along with potassium, fuels the vast majority of the heat in the Earth's interior.\nTo date, detecting antineutrinos has been painfully slow, with scientists recording only about 16 events per year from the underground detectors KamLAND in Japan and Borexino in Italy. However, researchers predict that three new detectors expected to come online by 2022--the SNO+ detector in Canada and the Jinping and JUNO detectors in China--will add 520 more events per year to the data stream.\n\"Once we collect three years of antineutrino data from all five detectors, we are confident that we will have developed an accurate fuel gauge for the Earth and be able to calculate the amount of remaining fuel inside Earth,\" said McDonough.\n\"Knowing exactly how much radioactive power there is in the Earth will tell us about Earth's consumption rate in the past and its future fuel budget,\" said McDonough. \"By showing how fast the planet has cooled down since its birth, we can estimate how long this fuel will last.\""}

{"prompt": "Composting is the ultimate win-win-win for gardeners.\nIt is recycling at its most basic, turning yard and kitchen waste into rich, organic planting material. It saves money on fertilizer and pesticides. It keeps earthworms working and off the street.\nThere are several types of composting that involve varying degrees of commitment. Aerobic, which uses air to compost, is quick, but high maintenance because your heap needs frequent turning; anaerobic, both low-maintenance and very slow, is done without air and involves letting waste sit undisturbed for years; vermicomposting employs red worms, bacteria and insects to break down matter (medium maintenance and speed).\nBut, as Brett L. Markham points out in his excellent \"The Mini Farming Guide to Composting\" (Skyhorse Publishing), nature is on your side: No matter which method you choose, it's nearly impossible to screw this up. \"Nature loves compost,\" he writes, \"and will turn anything that was once alive (or produced by something living) into compost all", "baseline": "by itself.\"\nSo let's set up an aerobic composting bin.\nWhat you need: Markham recommends chicken-wire bins: four posts (six is better, so you can have two side-by-side bins) and 48-inch-high chicken wire. Why two bins? One for new material, and the other for compost that's farther along in the decomposition process.\nFind a location: Practically speaking, try to set up near the garden where you'll be spreading your compost. Moving vast amounts across your property will wear you out. In their book \"The Complete Compost Gardening Guide\" (Storey), Barbara Pleasant and Deborah L. Martin note that you may have to strike a balance: Compost heaps do better in shade, but gardens are in the sun.\nWhat's in? What's out? For a basic aerobic compost heap, grass clippings, leaves (run them through a leaf grinder, if you can, to reduce their size and speed up the process), twigs and other plant materials are all welcome. Indoor fodder can include coffee grounds, tea bags, fruit and vegetable scraps, even freezer-burned vegetables. No meats, no fats. Bones, though, if thoroughly cooked, are fine (they provide calcium and phosphorous). But bury them at least 3 inches down.\nCritters: Worms and insects help break down the compost material. Other garden-helpful insects, such as crickets, take refuge in the compost heap. If you add bones and they get exposed, you may have to fend off raccoons (or, more likely, the neighbor's poodle). The chicken wire should be a sufficient deterrent.\nMaintenance: When starting fresh, you may want to buy a bag of commercial compost \u2014 its bacteria and other microorganisms are already cranked up \u2014 and toss it in to get your bin percolating. Once you're up and running, add some of your own mature compost to your second bin. Turn your material every couple of days. To get air into the mix \u2014 this is aerobic composting, remember \u2014 drive a short length of rebar into the pile and wiggle it around to make a hole and promote air penetration. Do this at several points. Monitor the temperature. As the decomposition process accelerates, the temperature will rise. (Specially made thermometers are sold at garden centers.) If the temp gets above 150 degrees, the process can slow down or stop. Frequent mixing will prevent that from happening.\nMoisture is a must for successful compost. For aerobic, the material should feel damp and clump together, but not be so wet that water can be squeezed out. If your aerobic pile is too dry, turn it and add water.\nWhen is it ready? Markham says that immature compost produces chemicals that prevent germination. When you see earthworms thriving in your pile and weeds are starting to sprout, your compost is ready."}

According to organisers, the campaign will start by focusing simply on getting those suffering from mental health problems to feel comfortable talking about their experiences.\n\u201cIf someone had cancer in your family or diabetes, you wouldn\u2019t be afraid to seek help or talk about it,\u201d Dennis Wharton, a communications executive for the National Association of Broadcasters, told IPS.\nWharton says the new ads will not star celebrities, but instead feature a cross-section of U.S. society. \u201cBecause mental health knows no gender or race boundaries \u2013 this affects all walks of life,\u201d he says.\nSignificant resources will be aimed at people who have served in the U.S. military.\nFor instance, Blue Star Families, an advocacy group for military families, will be producing a series of ads featuring country music stars urging veterans with mental health problems to seek help.\nAccording to Barbara Van Dahlen, president of Give an Hour, a mental health advocacy group for veterans, says it\u2019s unsurprising that many veterans suffer from mental illness, given their wartime experiences.\nVan Dahlen stresses the need for trauma and substance abuse to be included in the category of mental illnesses. Advocates emphasise that substance abuse is an indicator of deeper problems, often mental health issues \u2013 and that dealing with those problems often helps with the substance abuse, as well.\nPresident Obama announced that in coming months more than 150 \u201csummits\u201d, similar to Monday\u2019s conference, would take place across the country. Hosted by the Department of Veteran Affairs, these will be held between July and September.\n\u201cWhat we ultimately want to do is take the conversations we are having today in the White House, and take them to school auditoriums, community centres, houses of worship, living rooms and kitchen tables across this country,\u201d Health Secretary Sebelius said.\nNonetheless, she also warned of the presence of significant barriers to the new initiative, particularly given years of cost-cutting and the current environment of financial austerity.\nThe president\u2019s 2014 budget, for instance, has a request for the training of 5,000 new mental health providers, particularly those who can work with people to transition into university.\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Health\u2019s Fitzpatrick, the United States currently requires a massive effort to train practitioners and other medical professionals to be able to offer some form mental health care. Currently, he says, many who are actively seeking help simply cannot find it.\nFirst, however, the new Obama administration push on this issue is focusing on trying to make people comfortable enough to discuss their experiences in the first place. In closing comments Monday, Vice-President Biden drew on personal experiences to urge others seek out mental health-related help if they need it."}
{"prompt": "Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani exits following a news conference on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, September 26, 2018. Photo: REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid/File Photo.\nJNS.org \u2013 Recent reports that the Iranians have removed their personnel from southern Syria and transferred their main activity hub from Damascus International Airport to the T-4 airbase in the heart of the Syrian desert indicate that the first round of the Iranian-Israeli conflict in Syria has ended in resounding defeat for Tehran.\nSome in Israel voiced concern and criticized the government\u2019s decision, which the defense establishment had encouraged, to wage a campaign against Iranian entrenchment in Syria. It is a fact, however, that the determination displayed by Israel bore fruit and its objectives were met without sparking a war on the northern border and while avoiding a diplomatic crisis with Russia.\nThe important takeaway from the first round is that those who dare, win. Iran blinked first and chose to duck", "baseline": "a fight with Israel. It\u2019s also possible it didn\u2019t want to push its luck in terms of its relations with Bashar Assad and Vladimir Putin, the patron of the Damascus regime.\nThis further evidences the limitations of Iran\u2019s power and certainly that of its Quds Force, the foreign arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Syria. The Quds Force couldn\u2019t establish a solid foothold in Syria once Israel began pummeling it and therefore its ability to retaliate, threaten, and mainly deter Israel is still limited.\nIt\u2019s not for nothing that Quds Force chief Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani wants the current government in Israel to fall. He even believes, according to media leaks, that a strong Iranian response to Israeli attacks in Syria could influence the outcome of the upcoming election in Israel. Iran is possibly behind Palestinian Islamic Jihad\u2019s recent attempts in Gaza to spark another clash with Israel on the southern front. The Iranians want to influence the election results in Israel and at the very least deter Israel\u2019s leadership from continuing the campaign against them in Syria. In the meantime, this hasn\u2019t been working.\nAs stated, however, this is only the first round. The Iranians won\u2019t throw in the towel so easily. Their presence in Syria, alongside their entrenchment in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, is a strategic goal for which they have spilled blood and spent billions of dollars. We can assume Iran will persist with efforts to establish a presence in Syria, even if in the country\u2019s north, in the hope that the Russians will curb Israel\u2019s attempts to uproot them from there as well. After all, in contrast to Israel, Russia doesn\u2019t view Tehran\u2019s presence in Syria as a threat and believes that it can curtail the Iranians.\nMeanwhile, Iran last week celebrated the 40-year anniversary of its Islamic Revolution. On Feb. 1, 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran riding the wave of protests against the Shah\u2019s regime and wrested control of the country for him and his cohort of clerics. These have been 40 years of uncompromising fanaticism, increasing international isolation, unrelenting subversion in the region and beyond, and burning hatred for the United States and Israel. But more importantly for the citizens of Iran, it has been 40 years of corrupt and violent dictatorial rule that has led the country to the brink of social and economic ruin.\nIran\u2019s only dubious achievements over this time, not coincidentally, pertain mostly to its ballistic missiles, which it touts day and night. The latest \u2014 a cruise missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers (around 800 miles) \u2014 was unveiled last week to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.\nIt isn\u2019t clear, by the way, if the reports from Tehran are accurate. To be sure, the Iranians tend to distort and exaggerate such accomplishments even when their missiles are far from being operational. What is pertinent, however, is Iran\u2019s trend and ongoing intention of manufacturing missiles capable of reaching not just Israel but Europe and in the future the United States as well.\nThe price for these missiles, as we all know, is being paid by the people of Iran; mainly the country\u2019s youth who have essentially been sentenced to a life of economic hardship, poverty, and ignorance and mostly a lack of hope for a better future. The gap between the Iranian people and their leaders has never been larger and another revolution to topple the regime is undoubtedly only a matter of time. This is still quite a few years away, however, because the ayatollahs, similar to their ally Assad, are willing to kill millions before bidding adieu to the global stage."}
{"prompt": "Home Procurement News Why is lean accounting necessary in the supply chain?\nWhy is lean accounting necessary in the supply chain?\nKnowing how to manage your finances is important for any business. If you aren't sure how much money you have in your accounts, you won't be able to pay your bills. Overseeing cash flow is crucial for keeping your finances in order. However, the processes in the supply chain are changing, and you'll need an accounting method that will accommodate those switches.\nWhat accounting methods are currently used?\nTraditionally, there are two main techniques for overseeing the money coming in and going out of a company: accrual and cash. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. However, one may benefit the business more than the other depending on the size and income of the company.\nWith cash accounting, you don't count any transactions until you receive payments or the bills are taken out of your account, explained NOLO, an online legal resource for consumers and businesses. This method is used primarily by smaller businesses and may offer a more accurate account of your finances.", "baseline": "Because you don't record any payments coming in or going out of the company until they're actually received, you'll always know how much money you have in the bank. However, this may provide an inaccurate statement of your successes and struggles because sales cannot be recorded until payments are received.\nAccrual accounting is the opposite. Revenue and expenses are included in your budget when the services are completed or the products are delivered, according to NOLO. This allows you to keep a more accurate record of your cash flow, as you'll see your sales as they happen. However, this may give the appearance that you have more or less money than is actually in your accounts.\nHow does the supply chain affect accounting?\nIn today's society, more emphasis has been placed on conserving resources and protecting the environment. However, with traditional manufacturing methods, that cannot always happen. Both materials and money can go to waste, as companies are thinking in terms of mass production, explained BMA Inc., a lean manufacturing consulting company. This can lead to excess inventory for businesses and higher costs for consumers.\nA new workflow has made its way to the market to reduce these results. Lean manufacturing works to reduce waste, meet demand, lower prices and create a more efficient supply chain, the Journal of Accountancy claimed. Processes in production are moved near each other so that the products can switch stations with ease. This cuts lead-time and lowers prices because companies are able to create products when their customers want them. However, this manufacturing process requires a special type of accounting to take these changes into consideration.\nLean accounting allows people to make real-time decisions based on weekly reports and production expenses, Luis Socconini, the founder and director of the Lean Six Sigma Institute, explained to IndustryWeek contributor Michele Nash-Hoff. The method can improve accounts payable and receivable, payroll, inventory and budgets. Lean accounting may even be able to help determine prices and see which products are successful.\nShortened delivery times from three weeks to four days.\nReduction in inventory storage from six months to less than two months.\nIncreased employee productivity to $2,750 from $1,560.\nDespite the benefits, not many businesses have made the switch to the new method. However, Socconini believed lean accounting will be popular in the next five to 10 years.\nBy switching to lean accounting, you are able to accommodate the changes in the supply chain. The efficiency and speed of the new manufacturing process will need to be accounted for in the financial records, as traditional cash and accrual accounting may not be as accurate throughout all parts of the workflow."}

{"prompt": "Whenever \u201cnation building\u201d gets trotted out you can be pretty sure the advocates of the subject proposal have little confidence in the logic of their argument. The big question to my mind is why anyone who knows anything about transport and cities still takes this idea seriously.\nWhy is this even a thing? Why are we still talking about east coast HSR in 2019 as if it\u2019s a pressing national priority?\nIt\u2019s not because there\u2019s an obvious problem to be addressed. There\u2019s already a regular public transport service operating on this route. It\u2019s got adequate capacity and scope to scale up in line with demand. Importantly, it\u2019s a competitive market with four major operators i.e. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin.\nThis isn\u2019t like a new outer suburban growth area where there\u2019s no rail access at all. East coast HSR is about replacing one form of public transport with another. That\u2019d be fine except for the fact it hinges on provision of a mammoth subsidy.\nIt\u2019s not because it only requires a modest outlay of a few billion dollars or so. Any discussion of", "baseline": "east coast HSR must be in the context of the truly monumental level of public subsidy required to build it. The 2013 study undertaken by Labor and the Greens put the capital cost at $114 \u2013 $127 billion (that\u2019s a \u2018b\u2019) and made it clear virtually all of that would have to come from the public purse.\nBut we know it\u2019s near-certain the cost would be much higher, probably in the range $150 \u2013 $200 billion, because early scoping studies like this invariably grossly under-estimate the cost, largely due to optimism bias (see Why do the worst infrastructure projects get built? and Are cost estimates for transport projects reliable?). The cost of building California HSR was initially estimated at $33 billion in 2008; by 2018 it had escalated to $63.2 \u2013 $98.1 billion.\nIs it instead of a second Sydney Airport?\nIt\u2019s not because Sydney\u2019s second airport isn\u2019t going ahead. One of the key arguments for east coast HSR was that it might obviate or delay the need to build a costly second airport in Sydney. That\u2019s no longer relevant. Construction of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport at Badgerys Creek started on September 2018, with completion scheduled for December 2026.\nIn fact, the new airport weakens the case for east coast HSR. According to the Labor/Greens HSR feasibility study, that\u2019s because it would reduce a key driver of demand for HSR \u2013 delays and unpredictability of flight times at Kingsford Smith airport arising from air traffic congestion. The study found the new airport would lower the demand for HSR into and out of Sydney and therefore decrease the economic benefits.\nIs it to tackle emissions?\nIt\u2019s not because it\u2019s an efficient way of reducing emissions. After allowing for additional emissions from construction, operation and induced demand, east coast HSR would yield net savings of 55 Mt CO2-e over 50 years. That sounds good, but given the estimated cost of construction it would be an extraordinarily expensive way of addressing climate change i.e. circa $2,000 per tonne of CO2-e avoided. At a more likely $150 billion for construction, the cost rises to $2,700 per tonne (see So high speed rail would increase carbon emissions?).\nThat scale of subsidy would have a much larger impact on emissions if it were instead used to fund renewable power generation. The Bloomberg New Energy Finance energy outlook estimates the cost of making 92% of generation in Australia from renewable sources by 2050 is $186 billion.\nIs it to improve equity?\nIt\u2019s not because it would be more equitable. The great bulk of benefits from east coast HSR would come from faster trips between Sydney and Melbourne for business travellers. This group currently pays the full capital and operating cost of air travel; there\u2019s no reason why it should now be gifted such a titanic subsidy.\nIs it much, much faster?\nIt\u2019s not because east coast HSR would be significantly faster than flying. CBD business people are the key beneficiaries; they\u2019d save 15 minutes door-to-door travelling from Melbourne CBD to Sydney CBD, compared to what\u2019s currently a three-hour journey by air (although HSR would be slower from Sydney to Brisbane than air). Nice, but hardly worth a couple of generations worth of infrastructure subsidy.\nIs it to decentralise big cities?\nIt\u2019s not because it would encourage decentralisation and \u201cgrow the regions\u201d. The Labor/Greens feasibility study couldn\u2019t find any net benefits from regional development. Heavily subsidised HSR fares from somewhere like Shepparton to Melbourne (notwithstanding that air fares aren\u2019t subsidised!) wouldn\u2019t shift high-paying jobs from the capital cities to the regions. Rather, they\u2019d just promote regional sprawl by creating remote dormitory suburbs for city centre workers.\nIs it to reduce housing costs?\nIt\u2019s not because it would reduce housing costs appreciably compared to the capital cities. They\u2019ll be much the same in Goulburn as they are in the outer suburbs of Sydney. It\u2019s hard to see why sprawl in Goulburn or Yass would somehow be better than sprawl in Liverpool (see Will business really pay for High Speed Rail? and Is value capture the silver bullet for funding infrastructure?).\nIt\u2019s not because it would be \u201ctransformative\u201d or \u201cnation building\u201d as claimed by Ms Rice and Mr Albanese. How can that be the case when it will mostly do pretty much what planes already do i.e. move travellers between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne?\nThe fact that it\u2019s a bit faster than flying for some potential users doesn\u2019t make it \u201ctransformative\u201d or \u201cnation building\u201d. This is nothing like the huge increase in speed that trains in the 19th century, and subsequently planes in the post-war era, brought to east coast inter-capital travel. The only way it might be transformative is if it were to destroy the competitive airline services between Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne, leading to higher fares and/or fewer services, and perhaps ultimately an HSR monopoly.\nFaster trains might well have a role in the future in connecting far-flung suburbs and major regional centres like Canberra and Newcastle to Sydney, but something like the 160 km/h Type D Trainset currently being tested for the New Airport Line in Beijing is likely to be a much better fit than the 350 km/h HSR service touted by Mr Albanese and Ms Rice.\nPublic funding on the scale required to build east coast HSR could be more usefully deployed in many other ways. For example, it could be used to improve over-loaded public transport systems in capital cities (e.g. see What would happen if public transport use grew faster?).\nIt says something truly awful about our political culture and the standard of public discourse, especially around cities and transport, that this foolishness still has legs. I don\u2019t expect gunzels are going to lose their enthusiasm for east coast HSR, but it\u2019s way past time politicians, academics and the commentariat got over this folly. And it\u2019s time to be a great deal more circumspect with terms like \u201cnation building\u201d."}

{"prompt": "It takes a lot to make me feel ashamed of London, my beloved home city. But yesterday\u2019s tower-block inferno did it. The raging fire at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, the disturbing speed with which this home to hundreds was reduced to a smouldering shell of a building, heaps shame on this city. It is positively Dickensian, a hellish scene out of place in 2017, like a violent echo from an older era when safety, especially the safety of the poor, was of little moment. London needs to look in the mirror. This cannot just be chalked up to \u2018tragedy\u2019.\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it was the low social status of the inhabitants of the tower that left them vulnerable to this horror. That\u2019s a serious charge, I know, but how else do we explain that residents who complained about fire hazards were ignored? The Grenfell Action Group residents\u2019 association complained to the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) \u2014 which manages Grenfell \u2014 about \u2018terrifying power surges\u2019 caused by \u2018faulty wiring", "baseline": "\u2019. It predicted that only a \u2018serious fire in a tower block\u2019 would lead to KCTMO being \u2018brought to justice\u2019. It remains to be seen how neglectful KCTMO was, if it was at all, but it is profoundly concerning that residents say their complaints were ignored. Their worries \u2018fell on deaf ears\u2019, they say. It\u2019s hard to imagine the residents of one of Kensington\u2019s plusher, more pleasing-to-the-eye builds being treated like this.\nThere are many specific questions that must be asked \u2014 and answered \u2014 about this horrific fire. Most pressingly: how did a fire in one flat spread with such ferocious speed to the entire block? A flat-based fire can be a simple accident (though we don\u2019t yet know if this fire was accidental or deliberate). But when such a fire moves upwards and upwards with nightmarish intensity, engulfing home after home, it\u2019s not an accident. Then it becomes something else; then it becomes clear that the fire has been enabled by something, perhaps by the decisions and actions of others. In this case, recent refurbishment, including the addition of seemingly flammable cladding, raises serious questions about materials used on buildings and official fire regulations. Also, why don\u2019t all tower blocks have sprinklers? And decent fire alarms that can actually be heard? These specific issues must be pored over, urgently, post this inferno.\nBut there are broader questions, too. Most importantly, there\u2019s the housing crisis, the dearth of new build, and how this has helped to warp the housing market so that homes in Britain, and especially in London, are pretty much unaffordable to normal people. The failure of both Tory and Labour governments to build the millions of new homes Britain needs has messed up the economy and society in ways we sometimes fail to appreciate. Bank of England governor Mark Carney was right to warn in 2014 that \u2018there are not sufficient houses [being] built in the UK\u2019, and that this lack, this dearth, is ramping up house prices, intensifying borrowing, and storing up serious problems for \u2018financial durability\u2019.\nBut the housebuilding failure hasn\u2019t only twisted prices and blown up economic bubbles \u2014 it has also had a dire impact on society, too, on community life, even on the value we attach to certain citizens. It has created a situation where developers, and the local councils who love them, tend always to have the super-rich in mind; tend to erect new builds they know will be snapped up by those flush with cash: wealthy foreigners or filthy-rich Brits. In the midst of this market-lighted process of gentrification, the poorer inhabitants of places like Kensington and Chelsea sometimes come to be seen as a pain, as squatters almost, whose towering blocks or state-funded homes are in essence vast concrete barriers to the making of huge amounts of money.\nAnd so do the poorer inhabitants of certain boroughs come to be seen, inexorably, as a problem, as pests, their concerns easily ignored. After all, wouldn\u2019t it be better if they left? If they cleared the way for new opportunities for wealth creation for the few? This is the inhumanity unwittingly unleashed by our warped housing crisis, and by the recession more broadly, and it is, if you will forgive me, disgusting.\nSince that benighted building and the family homes it contains went up in flames 24 hours ago, there has been a rush to pin the blame on \u2018evil\u2019 individuals. We\u2019ve seen an outburst of Tory-bashing in particular. Boris is to blame, for cutting fire services. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May\u2019s new chief-of-staff, is also getting it in the neck for having allegedly \u2018sat on\u2019 a report about how tower blocks are vulnerable to fire. This craven search for the one evil Tory to blame for this calamity is also Dickensian. It\u2019s a Dickensian breed of moralism that prefers to bash wicked individual landlords or nasty Scrooges rather than address the bigger social and economic underpinnings of tragedies like this. Finger-pointing and the desire to feel good and pompous become a substitute for examining how both Tory and Labour governments have helped to warp the housing question through their failures of housing ambition.\nI was born into overcrowded social housing in West London, not far from Grenfell. So I know something of how social-housing residents are mistreated, how they can come to be viewed as lesser citizens than those with money and influence, whether it\u2019s by Labourites hectoring them for their \u2018nasty neighbour\u2019 behaviour or the rich wishing they would move on. It must stop. We have it in our power to ensure that nothing like the Grenfell fire ever happens again, if we ask the right and hard questions."}

He warned the Americans that the British were coming, the British were coming, and they were going to try take our arms and we got to make sure that we were protecting ourselves and shoring up all of ammunitions and our firearms so that they couldn't take it.\nBut remember that the British had already been there, many soldiers for seven years in that area. And part of Paul Revere's ride \u2013 and it wasn't just one ride \u2013 he was a courier, he was a messenger. Part of his ride was to warn the British that we're already there. That, hey, you're not going to succeed. You're not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have. He did warn the British.\nSo, Sarah Palin claimed that Paul Revere was a Revolutionary-era NRA member whose famous ride was for a British audience, to let them know Americans were going to win the war because they believed in gun rights.\nPalin's aim \u2013 insofar as she had one \u2013 was to blow a dog-whistle for her supporters, turning the Revolutionary war into a tale about gun ownership. That's not historically inaccurate \u2013 it's the reason there is a second amendment defending the right to bear arms in the first place.\nBut her supporters couldn't resist trying to make history conform more closely to her version, by editing the Wikipedia entry covering Revere's ride. The rewriting was first spotted by the political website Little Green Footballs: \"Man, you've gotta almost admire the sheer blind dedication of Sarah Palin's wingnut acolytes.\"\nOfficial: What was the cause of the Civil War?\nOfficial: Wait, wait.

{"prompt": "It's a fantastic update to a favorite tool for chefs and bartenders.\nWiredA fantastic update to a favorite tool for chefs and bartenders. Improvements over the original version make everything better.\nTiredIt's a narrow niche for home use. Consider if you're into this kind of thing before purchasing and filing it away in a drawer after only one use. The screen filter also has a tendency to pop through the burn chamber.\nTrundle through as many fancy restaurant kitchens as I have and you'll start recognizing specialized tools, big and small: little offset spatulas, slablike flat-top griddles, high-powered Vitamix blenders, spoonulas. For years now, many of those kitchens also used something that looks like a cross between a black squirt gun and a battery-powered hookah.\nThis thing, the PolyScience Smoking Gun, uses a tiny fan to draw a flame across a teaspoon of wood chips or other combustibles to produce a steady stream of smoke, which it expels through a long tube. You can do", "baseline": "some pretty cool things with it: I've seen chefs present food under a clear glass cloche full of smoke, lifting it tableside to reveal a dish; bartenders will smoke a glass, the booze, or an entire cocktail to impart varying degrees of smokiness. When I worked on The Willows Inn\u2019s cookbook, Sea and Smoke, chef Blaine Wetzel would cold-smoke mussels in a smoker for four hours, sear them on the flat top to caramelize them, tuck them back in their shells, pop them in a tiny cedar box, pipe alder smoke into the box, and immediately walk it out into the dining room, where diners opened the box, sending a puff of smoke billowing toward the ceiling.\nDespite its ability to turn a dish or a drink into a showstopper, the original Smoking Gun, like that plastic squirt gun, feels a bit chintzy. It's also poorly balanced: Even in its stand, a tug on the tube can cause the whole thing to fall over and make a literal hot mess.\nVersion two, the Smoking Gun Pro ($150)\u2014a joint venture between PolyScience and Breville\u2014solves these problems and improves on the original in just about every way. The original, now referred to as the \"legacy\" version, is being phased out. In a confusing bit of marketing and nomenclature, there is also the Breville Smoking Gun (no PolyScience, no Pro, $100), with a smaller footprint, diminished capabilities, and less weight.\nThe Pro offers new features, like a large base for stability, a variable speed fan, and a big shiny removable metal barrel that gives it heft, durability, and undeniable cool. It's easily disassembled, and many of the components are dishwasher-safe. Comparing the new versions, the non-pro model looks like a cash grab. If, like most people, you've never heard of these things and are now considering one, save your pennies a little longer and go Pro.\nI went to see bartender Jamie Boudreau of the high-end Canon bar in Seattle, and there on the front corner of the bar sat his Smoking Gun Pro. For Boudreau, there are two ways to smoke a drink: in and around. \"In is for flavor more than aroma\u2014you get a smokiness in the mouth,\" he says. To do this, he pours the booze in a decanter with smoke and gives it a quick shake. \"I lean toward the darker spirits. Clear spirits like gin are more delicate, and the smoke can overtake the drink.\"\nHe keeps this in mind making his Khaleesi cocktail. Boudreau brings a glass skull full of tea smoke to the table, adds a mix of Punt e Mes, Blanton's single-barrel bourbon, and some other lovely ingredients, gives it a quick shake, and pours immediately. Just two shakes, he says\u2014more than that, and you risk the smoke overpowering the drink.\nFor the around technique, he pipes smoke into a clear smoking box, inundating either the glass or the entire drink in the terrarium-like cube: for example, he might smoke a Manhattan with strawberry tea. Boudreau is clearly a big fan of the Pro. His only quibble is that the screen the wood chips can pop right through the burn chamber (something I experienced during testing), which he avoids by cutting his own screen instead of using the smaller circles that come with the Smoking Gun.\n\"Other than that,\" he summarizes, \"everything is better.\"\nEverything about the Smoking Gun Pro is so much better that chefs and bartenders who have a legacy version ought to seriously consider replacing it. As for everyone else, do you really need one? Tough call. As my wife said, \"This wouldn't rate a spot on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Not even the frivolous end.\"\nWith further testing, particularly with food, I learned to think of the smoke more like a seasoning: A nice addition, but it doesn't completely change the meal. You can blend it into a soup or a salsa or whip it into mashed potatoes. You can smoke a salad. You can use all kinds of wood to make smoke or, like Boudreau, you can smoke tea leaves. It's showy and fun\u2014and very easy to imagine someone buying it or receiving it as a gift, using it once, and never pulling it out of the drawer.\nThen again, what do I know about people? I bought a bottle of Famous Grouse and brought it, along with the Pro and a utility lighter, to poker night at my buddy Brian's house. We went out to his patio to keep the smoke detector from going off, had everyone try a taste of the \"regular\" whisky, then combined some with mesquite smoke in an empty glass bottle, gave it two quick shakes, and poured a round of shots. The mesquite gave the Scotch a pleasant burnt-marshmallow flavor that everybody was into. Several hands later, Brian pulled out a bottle of Cazadores Reposado and we ran the same experiment on tequila. Here the results were mixed, but it was a lot of fun.\nIn short, it was a big, showy success, the guys got really into it, and we all tottered off into the night with a smoky buzz."}
{"prompt": "The Make Comedy Great Again Tour stars, from left, Tina Giorgi, Jeff Allen, Earl David Reed, Brad Upton and Ross Bennett.\nALBANY \u2014 Despite its obvious echo of a decidedly partisan slogan, the \"Make Comedy Great Again\" Tour promises that it will be an evening of five comics who work in an older tradition, namely one free of politics and vulgarity.\nSaturday's show at The Egg ran for more than two hours, yet it never got stronger than PG-13 in language and innuendo, and it was a clear hit with a freely laughing audience that had an age range as broad as any I've seen for stand-up comedy, from about a kid about 11 to a couple in their 70s.\nEven before the national exposure of the special, interest in MCGA has been so strong that the tour, produced by The Comedy Works in Saratoga Springs, is already looking at booking 30 to 40 weekends' worth of dates next year, according to owner Tommy Nicchi.\nThe comedians' material isn't explicitly political, but", "baseline": "it is fundamentally conservative, in the larger sense of the word.\nOn the stage this manifested itself in a pair of grandpa personas: Brad Upton as the genial, slightly goofy one who's younger than his age and Jeff Allen as the only-62-but-already-a-geezer guy who walks effortfully and complains about his declining health and about everyone in his life. For Upton, getting older means sitting in the mall food court and staring longingly at plates going by, not the attractive young women carrying them. While this is to him a sign of deterioration, it's representative of MCGA that Upton would never consider that the food-carrying women think it's a major improvement. Allen is more explicitly sour, having crossed over into that late-middle-age period where men are so hen-pecked that it gets a big laugh when Allen says something like, \"I've been married 32 years, so it's not like I'm a man anymore anyway.\"\nIf they're the grumpy gramps of the tour, Ross Bennett is the weird uncle, with sproingy hair, thick glasses and a persona he describes as \"the science teacher that (all the students) suspected smokes pot.\" Though sentimentality was thickest with Bennett, it was also gentlest, culminating with a hilarious set-closing routine about sledding, the differences between toboggans and flying saucers and being mummified in scarf wrapped around his head so many times that it felt as if his mother was planning to pull-start a lawnmower.\nAbsolutely necessary to this mix is the ostensible opener/emcee, David Earl Reed, a black comic and morning-radio host in York, Pa., who is supremely skilled at zinging white audiences just up to their comfort levels. In a set that was as long as each of the others', Reed was masterful in his crowd work, riffing brilliantly on interactions with the audience, from late-comers to a monosyllabic 20something who, when asked about his career, said only, but enthusiastically, \"Concrete!\"\nNoting a black-white interracial couple sitting near the front, Reed said, \"You know what they say: Once you go black ....\"\nHe trailed off, letting the audience mentally fill in what they thought was coming. What he actually said was far more pointed than a a rhyming, sexually based clich\u00e9: \"Once you go black, your family leaves.\""}
{"prompt": "Take 5: How can we stop being jerky customers?\nThe customer may not always be right. What are some circumstances where they could be wrong?\nIn a recent trip to a grocery store, I grabbed my usual few items in a hand basket and took my wares to the cashier's counter. I set the basket on the table (not a conveyor belt, just a small table) and started to reach for my wallet.\nI looked up and the cashier was just staring at the basket, not moving. I asked her if everything was OK, and she replied, \"I never remove items from baskets.\"\nI didn't realize that was a thing.

Dropping kids off early or coming to pick them up late has a ripple effect people generally forget.\n\"While families are 'our customers,' they need to understand that teachers have a schedule to follow, too, and dropping kids off early and picking them up late prevents teachers from getting other responsibilities done. I\u2019d say probably the same for sports coaches,\" she said.\nPlanning for these circumstances is important. Part of planning, however, isn't giving your sick kid Tylenol that wears off in two hours so everyone ultimately has to deal with it (nurses, parents, teachers, classmates) anyway.\nFormer Community Press writer Liz Carey gave another example: Her husband used to work at CompUSA where a woman screamed at him for 15 minutes because his company didn't sell film for her digital camera. I'll give you a second to reread that.\nFor her contribution, Leslie Kohlman talked about the bane of restaurant managers: The habitual complainers who come in to get free meals. She said, \"I finally told a family you cost me money every time you walk in the door.\"\nI waited tables at Ground Round when the company had penny-per-pound day for kids meals. You'd be surprised how hard people will work to avoid paying for meals, even 65-cent dinners.\nTara Stroud had another restaurant issue. Some people don't understand how reservations/call-ahead/seating issues work. \"So many factors come into play when seating guests, i.e. party size, time of arrival, closed sections, smoking/non-smoking (used to), etc. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I had to field a customer complaint because of how they thought it should go. Everyone knows more than the employees when they want to be seated.\"\nNow, it's understandable what most consumers deal with: Tight home budgets, too many stressors and too much to do with no time to do it. However, no one gets paid enough to be a customer's human fidget spinner.\nIt's sad people talk to customer service workers in manners they'd never tolerate someone talking to their own loved ones.\nFor the record, when I have a handheld basket at the grocery store, I now ask cashiers if they want me to remove items from those baskets. So far, no one cared one way or the other, but it was nice to ask.\nThe Golden Rule isn't so hard to remember.\nMelanie Laughman is the digital preps planning editor for high school sports.

Willie Nelson is the Red Headed Stranger; his braids are as iconic as his illegal drug habit. That's why I focused on the evolution of hairstyles in country music for my new book Country Music Hair. From the 1960s to today, my first book is a tribute to the iconic hairstyles we loved on our favorite artists.\nWillie Nelson, \"The Red Headed Stranger\"\nIn my opinion, there has been no greater hair transformation in country music history than that of Willie Nelson. Most fans who see pictures of the icon in the 1960s cannot recognize him thanks to his clean-cut look. The 1970s brought shoulder-length hair and the first signs of what was to come. By the '80s, Nelson had become the man we think of today, full red braids and", "baseline": "a signature bandana.\nOne of my favorite quotes attributed to Dolly Parton is \"People ask me how long it takes to do my hair and I say, 'I don't know, I'm never there.'\" Parton has worn everything from a bouffant to long layers, but it's never been her real hair. Stylist Cheryl Riddle is responsible for getting each wig ready to wear, but surprisingly Parton still does her own makeup to this day.\nKelsea Ballerini is in the new class of country stars, finding her own way by honoring those who came before her. When it comes to hair, Ballerini doesn't go full wig, but she's a big supporter of clip-in hair extensions.

In 1959, Karnow reported on the first two American deaths in Vietnam, not suspecting that tens of thousands would follow.\nInto the 1970s, Karnow would cover the war off and on for Time, The Washington Post and other publications and then draw upon his experience for an epic PBS documentary and for the million-selling \u201cVietnam: A History,\u201d published in 1983 and widely regarded as an essential, even-", "baseline": "handed summation.\nKarnow\u2019s \u201cIn Our Image,\u201d a companion to a PBS documentary on the Philippines, won the Pulitzer in 1990.

He was a critic of the Vietnam War (and a name on President Nixon\u2019s enemies list) who still found cruelty and incompetence among the North Vietnamese. His friendship with Philippines leader Corazon Aquino did not stop him from criticizing her presidency.\nA salesman\u2019s son, Karnow was born in New York in 1925 and by high school was writing radio plays and editing the school\u2019s paper, a job he also held at the Harvard Crimson. He first lived in Asia during World War II when he served throughout the region in the Army Air Corps. Back in the U.S., he majored in European history and literature at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1947.\nHe began sending dispatches to a Connecticut weekly, where the owner was a friend, and in 1950 was hired as a researcher at Time. Promoted to correspondent, he would cover strikes, race car driving and the beginning of the French conflict with Algeria, but also interviewed Audrey Hepburn (\u201ca memorable if regrettably brief encounter\u201d) fashion designer Christian Dior and director John Huston, who smoked cigars, knocked back Irish whiskies and rambled about the meaning of Humphrey Bogart.

It was partly a Cold War time capsule, preoccupied with Communist influence, but was also skeptical enough of official policy to anticipate the fall of a key American ally, South Vietnamese president Ngo Dihn Diem, an event that helped lead to greater American involvement.\nLike so many others, Karnow initially supported the war and believed in the \u201cdomino theory,\u201d which asserted that if South Vietnam were to fall to communism its neighbors would too.\nBut by war\u2019s end, Karnow agreed with the soldier asked by a reporter in 1968 what he thought of the conflict: \u201cIt stinks,\u201d was the reply.\n\u201cThere are not many carefully delineated judgments in the book.

Along with much praise came criticism from the left and right.

A previous marriage, to Claude Sarraute (daughter of French novelist Nathalie Sarraute), ended in divorce in 1955.

{"prompt": "At The U.S. Olympic Trials, Mixed Opinions About Russian Doping Scandal : The Torch The Russian scandal is a hot topic at the U.S. track and field Olympic Trials. Some feel individual Russian athletes should be allowed to compete if they're clean, others support a blanket ban.\nThere will be a decision soon about whether some Russian track and field athletes can compete in the Olympics next month in Rio. This week, Russia filed an appeal after its track federation was banned because of state-sponsored doping. Despite efforts to stop it, doping is a persistent problem in track and field as NPR's Tom Goldman reports from the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore.\nTOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: It didn't take long in Eugene - matter of fact the first day of the trials - a brilliant blue sky day. There was a reminder of the shadow of doping.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Medal ceremony. Shot put men.\nGOLDMAN: A medal ceremony is a happy moment. The winner on this day", "baseline": "smiled as he stood wearing a victory wreath on his head. But it was bittersweet, coming 12 years late.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Gold medalist and 2004 Olympic champion representing the USA, Adam Nelson.\nGOLDMAN: Adam Nelson won a silver medal in the 2004 Olympic shot put competition. A few years ago, the gold medalist tested positive for a banned drug in retroactive testing, meaning Nelson was the winner. But then one of the most underwhelming victory moments ever - the gold medal was hand delivered to Nelson in 2013 in a food court at the Atlanta airport. Track officials in Eugene thought Nelson deserved better, so did the thousands of fans who cheered him last week at Hayward Field. Not long after those cheers, there were more reminders.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Gatlin and Bromell. Gatlin, Bromell.\nGOLDMAN: America's best sprinter proved it again in Eugene. Justin Gatlin won the 100-meter final Sunday in 9.80 seconds. That's a world best time this year. But during the weekend, about 30 people at Hayward Field wore T-shirts with the slogan runners against doping. It was a targeted and quiet protest against Gatlin and fellow sprinter Tyson Gay. Both have served doping suspensions. Thirty-four-year-old Gatlin served two.\nDoping is a charged issue for him, but in Eugene, Gatlin was willing to talk about the Russian scandal. I asked him whether some athletes who prove they're clean should be able to go to Rio, even though their track federation is banned.\nJUSTIN GATLIN: At the end of the day, I mean, you got to think about fair is fair. You know, if an athlete has come and he's been tested or she's been tested, and they've passed a test, I don't think they should, you know, basically prosecuted or make a statement with other people who have done wrong.\nGOLDMAN: Distance runner Stephanie Bruce is sponsored by Oiselle. That's the apparel company that organized the T-shirt protest. For Bruce, the situation is murkier with the Russian athletes who protest their innocence.\nSTEPHANIE BRUCE: How long have you been running in a culture like that and you don't know that it's going on and you haven't come forward? Like, you are totally oblivious that coaches or - you know what I mean? So that seems strange to me.\nGOLDMAN: It's not surprising that Adam Nelson, the man in the belated ceremony, takes a hardest line. He's a long-time anti-doping Fair Play advocate, but he's also a victim of doping. He was quoted as saying this, the reality is you make a ban on a country and then you allow the athletes to compete. It sends a mixed message.\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to decide by July 21 whether individual Russian athletes can compete in Rio. If the decision is no, it will be the first time that country isn't part of the Olympics' most prominent sport - track and field - since the former Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 LA Summer Games.

{"prompt": "The \u201ccar chase\u201d is another carryover from The Bourne Identity that Director Greengrass includes yet improves upon. Supremacy takes the clich\u00e9 car chase, injects it with steroids, and chases it with a Red Bull. The climax is easily the best car chase on screen in ten years. It\u2019s better than the The Matrix: Reloaded. Why? Supremacy isn't hindered by CGI. The chase is intense and real. When Bourne\u2019s car spins out of control and is simultaneously blind-sided by another car, I dare you not to flinch.\nAs my wife has mentioned many times before, Matt Damon is a good looking man. She also mentions his lovely smile. Well, you won\u2019t see Damon\u2019s pearly whites in The Bourne Supremacy, but you will see why he\u2019s one of the most talented actors of his generation. Forget about his buddy Ben Affleck, Damon knows how to capture the audience\u2019s attention with his talent not his girlfriends.\nWhen Paula Landy\u2019s (Joan Allen) CIA sting", "baseline": "ends terribly, the few clues left behind lead her to believe Jason Bourne (Damon) has ended his retirement. Her subsequent investigation of Bourne uncovers the closed Operation \u201cTreadstone\u201d and opens doors that others wish to remain sealed.\nHundreds of miles away, the real Jason Bourne enjoys a peaceful yet cautious life with Marie (Franka Potente). Unbeknownst to him, a Russian Kingpin and an American traitor plan on making Jason Bourne\u2019s retirement, permanent. After the hired assassin Kirill (Karl Urban) attempts to kill him, a resulting tragedy propels Bourne back towards the mysterious life that haunts his nights.\nBourne Identity director Doug Lyman brought us a thriller that was restrained until action was warranted. When the action began, it was relentless, cold, and efficient much like Bourne himself. Lyman rescued the secret agent genre from Spy Kids and Agent Cody Banks with a thriller that while grounded in realism, explodes upon the screen with a fury that no silly kid movie can hope to match.\nLyman passed on directing The Bourne Supremacy, but thankfully Paul Greengrass took the helm and kept Supremacy faithful to Lyman\u2019s vision. The major complaint one could find with Greengrass\u2019 style is an overuse of hand-held camera shots used to represent the cloudy/jumbled bits of memory floating in Bourne\u2019s head. I thought it worked well enough, however I can imagine some viewers finding it distracting.\nThe key to both movies is Matt Damon\u2019s portrayal of Bourne. With minimal dialogue, Damon gives a complicated performance as a man who struggles to discover who he was while consciously trying to distance himself from his past. Bourne is an assassin who needs amnesia to discover who he really should have been. Only Damon\u2019s talents could have shown us this. Do you really think his buddy Affleck could pull this off? What about Paul Walker or Vin Diesel? I don\u2019t think so. Amongst his peers, Damon is in an acting class by himself.\nWhether Lyman\u2019s vision or the directing of Greengrass can claim responsibility for The Bourne Supremacy\u2019s is open to debate. I don\u2019t care. At the very least, Greengrass knew not to screw up a good thing. With Matt Damon establishing himself as a talented and bankable star, The Bourne Supremacy will reign supreme at the box office and in the action-thriller genre."}

Borneo, which holds the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, and is just a stone\u2019s throw away \u2026 physically, culturally and linguistically. The two Malaysian states are familiar territory for me. I used to frequent them in the \u201980s and \u201990s as a site planning and landscape architectural consultant for real estate and resort developments there.\nI flew in from Singapore, where I was based for over a dozen years. I remember having to take small planes from there to Kuching and from there hop across Sibu, Bintulu and to Miri, where I had most of my projects. I felt like an Indiana Jones, albeit without the bullwhip and sidearm.\nKuching\u2019s cool cats are used for all of the city\u2019s major monuments.\nTimes have changed and that was two decades ago. I visited Kuching recently and was impressed with the extent of development. First, the airport has transformed from a utilitarian box into a well-designed terminal with distinctive Sawarakan touches (something we could", "baseline": "learn from). The City of Kuching has grown, too, but from all indications, its growth has been well managed.\nThe ride into the city is bereft of billboards and the creeping blights that line most of our provincial destinations. The cityscape, though obviously not as dense as our provincial cities, is rational, consistently clean, tree-lined, and green. We also got to our hotel within 15 minutes (compared to the hour or two required in major destinations in the Philippines).\nKuching\u2019s name comes from the Malaysian word for cat similar to ours. The actual etymology is that the name comes from the fruit mata-kuching (whose seeds look like cat\u2019s eyes). The city uses this name and theme consistently, a branding exercise that we can again learn from.\nOur hotel was one of several comfortable accomodations lining the city\u2019s picturesque Kuching River. The river, like our Pasig, was and still is the lifeblood of the city. It is used to connect the city to the lush tropical hinterlands and the sea.\nMost of the city is built on the southern side of the river, much like Iloilo city. The historic core is a mainly a pre-independence colonial city, when the white rajahs ruled Borneo; a long story we don\u2019t have space for here, but a colorful one that makes the city\u2019s story a compelling one.\nKuching\u2019s crocs are a lively bunch \u2014 this one in bronze guards the Esplanade plaza.\nIn the boom of the \u201980s, the city (and the State of Sarawak\u2019s Development Corporation) made a decision to rationally plan for growth \u2026 both from the overall context of the economy and from a specific goal of developing tourism.\nThe direction taken was to conserve the city\u2019s historic resources of architecture and culture, as well as to revive the waterfront. The riverside had deteriorated into a parking lot and the city turned its back to it. A new esplanade was planned, incorporating existing structures but also improving the urban design and landscape architecture to accommodate spaces for modern life and to make it attractive to visitors.\nThe modern Kuching esplanade was completed in the early \u201990s and immediately caught the attention of tourists regionally and internationally. The esplanade also helped to link one side of the city with the other and improved real estate value immensely.\nThe esplanade provided venues for community and state-wide events. The central plaza at one end provided a front door to the city from the river. Two view towers also marked this plaza and allowed boarding points for river boats (which increased in operation into today\u2019s regular tourist cruises).\nKayaking is super kool in Kuching.\nThe espalanade\u2019s success is seen in its popularity with locals. It is used for early morning jogging and tai chi. Children frequent it on weekends and food kiosks make it a rendezvous for teenagers.\nThe Kuching River has also been cleaned up (not that it was dirty). Kayaking is a growing sport and local schools hold competitions. The cleaned-up river and waterfront also led to the general sprucing up of the rest of the city and I saw little in the way of garbage or unkempt sites anywhere we went.\nWe (a bunch of international journalists and I) also came to Kuching for their world-renowned Rainforest World Music Festival. The festival, which started in 1997, is now a key date in the festival circuit world-wide.\nThe Rainforest Festival was a short bus ride into where else but the rainforest. The festival featured what else but world music by groups from Africa, South America, and Asia \u2026thank God, there were no pop groups, Beiber or Gaga wannabees. And yes, beer flowed freely (if you\u2019re wondering). A wonderful time was had by all. We went home quite satisfied with the festivities\u2019 overflowing menu of music, food, and spirits (the locals have also apparently taken to western (mostly Australian) wine \u2026 with good chardonays, shirazs, cabernet sauvignons available from kiosks.\nCool Kuching river cruises are available every day.\nI spent the last day in Kuching walking up and down the one-kilometer esplanade. It is now being extended to allow for more (coordinated) development as the city expands. One hotel, in fact, the 360 Hotel, used a Filipino consultant, architect Yolly Reyes. It has wonderfully modern interiors (embellished in the lobby with a fantastic mural by Robby Mananquil). The city, the capital of Sarawak state, is also the jumping point for adventures into the state\u2019s vast nature preserves, mountains, falls and coastal destinations.\nThe city museum was built in 1851 and modeled after a European town hall.\nI do have friends, too, in Kuching. Juan Lacsamana, or Johnny, is a colorful character whose wedding in Kuching I attended in the early \u201990s. He married a local princess and the ceremony, which lasted into the wee hours of the next day, was a classic tale filled with cake fights (started by the best man, his brother Joel), head-banging music and wild dancing, capped by a wild chase around the city ending at the airport. But that\u2019s another story entirely! Regardless of the adventure you\u2019re looking for, from natural to not-the-ordinary, Kuching is truly kool!"}

Create the core or \u201ctrunk\u201d for the tree using a whiteboard or large paper flipchart that is easy to write on and is visible to all participants. In the center of the core, briefly summarize the decision to be made. For example, if you are thinking about diversifying your product offerings, you would write \u201cNew product development?\u201d in the core.\nFrom the core of your tree, draw two main \u201cbranches\u201d or lines that represent the pros and cons of the decision. Using the example of a new product introduction, pros might include increased earnings, entry into new markets and portfolio diversification. Cons could include financial risk and the necessary investment in new machinery and", "baseline": "employees.\nContinue to expand your decision tree by drawing potential \u201coutcome\u201d lines from each of your individual pros and cons. Following the same example, outcomes for increased earnings could include business stability, increased market share and the ability to expand the size of the business. Outcomes for financial risk could include business debt, job loss and company dissolution.\nThe more complex the decision to be made, the more significant and complex the decision tree can become. You may opt to continue adding different line categories that allow you to go into greater detail about the processes to be considered as part of the decision-making approach. You could include financial projections, steps to be taken during each stage of the process, timelines for implementation and allocation of staff and resources.\nWhen the decision tree is fully branched out, weigh the outcomes of the two main \u201cpro\u201d and \u201ccon\u201d branches. This will help you talk through the information that is on the tree in front of you. Ideally, when the tree is complete, the group should have a firm idea of the best way to proceed. A note-taker may opt to supplement the tree with a written summary of the findings for further consideration and analysis.\nMcQuerrey, Lisa. \"Simple Example of a Decision Tree.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/simple-example-decision-tree-58613.html.

{"prompt": "Four oil spill sites in Nigeria identified by the UN, which Shell has claimed to have had cleaned up by contractors since 2011, are still polluted, says a report by Amnesty.\nOne of these sites, the Bomu manifold close to the village of Kegbara Dere in Ogoniland, is Nigeria\u2019s oil central: five major northbound Shell pipelines join four southbound ones which together carry 150,000 barrels of oil a day to the huge oil export terminal at Bonny 50 miles away. The junction is considered so important to the economy of Nigeria and Shell that it is surrounded by a high fence and guarded day and night by the military.\nBut the ageing 50-year-old pipes and rusty pumps have burst and spilt large quantities of oil at least seven times since 1990, and in 2009 a fire broke out lasting 36 hours, leading to another major spill. When UN environment programme (Unep) inspectors visited the site in 2010, they found high levels of contamination", "baseline": "all around Bomu, pollution 5m deep in places and oil spreading into nearby cassava fields, and water supplies.\nBack in 2010, Unep inspectors said, \u201cNothing appears to have been done about the pollution,\u201d and urged an immediate decontamination of the Bomu manifold along with 60 other heavily polluted sites in Ogoniland, all of which, they said, had been left untouched or only cursorily cleaned up by Shell and other oil companies since the 1970s.\nEarlier this year Amnesty International revisited the Bomu manifold three times and found the site still massively contaminated, despite claims from Shell and the Nigerian government\u2019s watchdog pollution body that it had been cleaned up satisfactorily in 2012.\n\u201cWater containing oil \u2026 flows along the path of the Shell pipelines. At places there are pools of oil. Some soil is black and hard. The three fish ponds, owned by a local family, are covered in a thick oily sheen, and show no signs of life. The spills \u2026 have contaminated fields and a neighbouring forest and have spread down into the Barabeedom swamp,\u201d says Amnesty, working with the Port Harcourt-based Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD).\nThe joint report is published to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the execution of nine Ogoni leaders, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. Amnesty alleges that in some cases, contractors employed by Shell admit simply to burying the pollution.\n\u201cThis is just a cover up. If you just dig down a few metres you find oil. We just excavated, then shifted the soil away, then covered it all up again,\u201d one contractor employed by Shell told Amnesty.\nThe report concerns sites at Bomu Manifold, Boobanabe, Barabeedom swamp and Okuluebu. It says: \u201cClaims by Shell that it has cleaned up heavily polluted areas of the Niger delta are blatantly false. The only plausible explanations for why the four sites could still be polluted, four years after Unep found high levels of contamination at each of them, are that no remediation was carried out, or remediation was carried out but was ineffective, or that other spills have occurred since then.\n\u201cIn two of the four cases explanation one is ruled out by Shell itself. The company has publicly stated that the sites were cleaned up. In those two locations, explanation three [that there was subsequent re-contamination from spills after 2011] is also not possible.\n\u201cAll four sites remain visibly contaminated, even though Shell says it has cleaned them. The investigation demonstrates this is due to inadequate clean-up, and not new oil spills,\u201d says the report.\nAmnesty says its investigators sought meetings with and wrote to both Shell and the government\u2019s oil spill regulator, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (Nosdra), seeking an explanation.\n\u201cShell said they were not available for meetings. A subsequent letter from the company suggested researchers look at information on Shell\u2019s website. But this provided little information on clean-up.\n\u201cNosdra is under-resourced and continues to certify areas as clean that are visibly polluted with crude oil,\u201d says Amnesty. \u201cThe government of Nigeria is failing to fulfil its duty to protect the human rights of people living in the Niger delta. It must substantially strengthen the capacity of Nosdra to regulate Shell and the activities of Shell\u2019s contractors,\u201d it says.\n\u201cBy inadequately cleaning up the pollution from its pipelines and wells, Shell is leaving thousands of women, men and children exposed to contaminated land, water and air, in some cases for years or even decades,\u201d says Amnesty researcher Mark Dummett.\n\u201cShell says theft is to blame for most oil spills on the Delta, but even if that were true it would not excuse the company\u2019s historic failure to clean up oil pollution. Shell\u2019s blame game can no longer deflect attention from its broken promises and neglected infrastructure,\u201d says Dummett.\nShell operates around 50 oil fields and 5,000km of pipelines in the Niger delta. According to the oil giant\u2019s own figures, there have been 1,693 oil spills leading to more than 350,000 barrels of crude oil being lost since 2007.\nShell has said it intends to clean up all the spills identified in the 2011 Unep report, but argues this could take some years.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Shell said: \u201cWithout access to the full report it is difficult to verify and respond to the detailed claims.\n\u201cImplementation of the Unep report is part of a wider programme of remediation, pipeline protection, community engagement and social investment activities being undertaken by the SPDC JV with its government, community and civil society partners in Ogoniland.\nUnep estimated in 2011 that it could take up to 30 years and $6bn to clean up the region.

Others include Alec Guiness (Star Wars' original Obi Wan Kenobi,) Ted Hughes (British Poet Lauret and husband to poet Sylvia Plath,) Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn in Peter Jackson\u2019s film adaptation of the The Lord of the Rings) and Fiona Shaw (Harry Potter\u2019s Aunt in the film adaptations of J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series).\nShaw also offers a performance interpretation of the poem, complete with music and sound effects. Shaw\u2019s performance is available as a short, standalone film, and as an audio reading that, like the other readings, follows the text as the performers read it.\nThe performances are all good, and hearing Eliot with his mid-Western-affected-proper-English continues to haunt and delight. Although the other readings offer more thoughtful emoting on behalf of the audience, Eliot's rendition provides the poet's internal rhythm and pauses, inflections and glottal stops.\nEliot's own notes, as mentioned, fueled enormous amounts of scholarship. Much of that scholarship was curated and condensed into line-by-line annotations derived taken from B.C. Southam\u2019s excellent A Student\u2019s Guide to the Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot. Southam\u2019s book serves as the source for the app\u2019s annotations. Click a line and the annotations display. These notes are fine for the casual reader, but because parts of Southam\u2019s book, like sources (on page 31-42 of the sixth edition) aren't included, the notes ultimately prove incomplete. To do the annotations justice, Touch Press needs to include Southam\u2019s introduction and appendix.\nAs my three bookshelves dedicated to Eliot attest, I will acquire interesting material related to Eliot, and this app counts as interesting material, especially given the lack of DVD or download access to the original BBC documentary from which its interviews were drawn (though most of the BBC Arena documentary can be found on YouTube). The commentaries are joyfully affirmative and personally insightful.\nFormer punk rocker Frank Turner draws connections to Bob Dylan and contemporary pop culture. Paul Keegan provides erudite comments on Eliot and his relationship to the poem. Jim McCue a history of publication. Craig Raine dishes haughty interpretations and observations. Fiona Shaw marvels and connects with personal anecdotes. Jeanette Winterson offers right-professorial insight. And Seamus Heaney discusses what The Waste Land means to him as a poet. Unfortunately, the entire collection of commentary fits much more with documentary film-making than with serious literary scholarship.\nI return to incompleteness here. Many important voices on Eliot don\u2019t appear in the app beyond scattered references to particular lines in the annotations. Most notably, these missing scholars include Hugh Kenner, Frank Kermode, F.O. Matthiessen, Lyndall Gordon, Helen Gardner, George Williamson and Russell Kirk. They may not be available as video (or audio), but their text remains important. The majority of these critics and scholars might have presented Touch Stone with licensing issues, but given the partnership with Faber, Helen Gardner\u2019s excellent tome, The Art of T.S. Eliot, would have been a good addition to the app\u2019s content.\nMuch of the early scholarship about Eliot and The Waste Land has not yet arrived in e-reader format, though much of it is available on scholarly websites. Selections of essays or chapters would go a long way to making the app a more useful resource. Even better, given the publication and financial resources associated with Touch Press, would be a site that linked to the app, providing additional reference material on-demand.\nThe app offers some additional data in the form of a very small set of poorly integrated snapshots meant to illustrate the poem, its author, his collaborators and the publishing process. Given the visual and location-based references in the poem, more images could surely be found that could lend value to the reading. The app would benefit from the publishers going beyond the slideshow by fully integrating the images with the line readings and annotations.\nI always felt that The Waste Land prepared me for success in the Internet age. The poem that Eliot wrote and Ezra Pound helped craft fills the consciousness with fragmented jumbles of allusion and synthesis, of memory and creation, of studied eloquence and discerning observation. Blogs and other web-based content sources with their wildly far-flung links echo The Waste Land in reality, if not intent.\nOn the surface, the poem seemingly weaves together incongruities, but on deeper study it reveals a multi-layered structure. That hodgepodge of sources force the reader to engage beyond the surface, much as the Internet forces one from the page being scanned, to underlying sources or additional commentary. Before Vanevar Bush suggested a hypertext-like idea, Eliot apparently thought in hypertext-like form, recording his internal musings, broad reading, personal experience and intellectual associations into an exculpated whole.\nFor readers coming to The Waste Land for the first time, an app on an iPad with video commentary and clickable links that illuminate its language and allusions provides an appropriate entry point. For people who have studied the poem over the years, the app offers convenient access and a few new, easily consumed perspectives. I can also argue for The Waste Land app as a compelling and relatively inexpensive tool for teaching the poem, but one far from complete in its library of criticism and interpretation, and shameful in its lack of references.\nThe app is perhaps best for those who want to re-read The Waste Land and reconnect with a writer and an age now far removed from contemporary experience. As a work of art, The Waste Land continues to reveal truths 90 years after its first publication, in a new era of raging uncertainty and despair tempered by emergent potential."}

{"prompt": "Manifesto is silent on the dangers copyright abuses pose to Internet freedom.\nThe Campaign for Liberty, a libertarian advocacy group founded by congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul (R-TX), is gearing up for an \"Internet freedom\" project that focuses on opposing government regulation of the Internet.\nA draft of the project's manifesto was first leaked by Buzzfeed. It warns that \"collectivist special interests\" are pushing for harmful Internet legislation.\nAccording to \"Internet collectivists,\" the document says, \"'Net neutrality' means government acting as arbiter and enforcer of what it deems to be neutral.\" The document criticizes antitrust regulation of successful Internet companies and government micromanagement of everything from the electromagnetic spectrum to tech companies' privacy practices.\nIt's not surprising that a libertarian activist organization would denounce government regulation of the high-tech economy. But we were surprised to see the document denounce the \"Internet collectivist\" view that \"what is considered to be in the public domain should be greatly expanded.\"\nWe don't see anything \"collect", "baseline": "ivist\" about expanding the public domain. Due to repeated extensions by Congress, copyrighted works from the 1920s are still under copyright protection, a situation that has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Indeed, a constitutional challenge to Congress's 1998 extension of copyright terms enjoyed the support of the libertarian Cato Institute and Nobel prize-winning economists such as Milton Friedman, Ronald Coase, and James Buchanan.\nIn a Thursday interview, Campaign for Liberty spokesman Matt Hawes assured Ars that the organization did not intend to endorse today's long copyright terms. \"We think the public domain is a terrific part of the Internet,\" he told us. Rather, he said, the group was worried that \"Internet collectivists\" would use the phrase \"public domain\" as \"code for getting the government more involved\" in copyright issues.\nStill, it would be nice for the organization to take a clearer stance against Hollywood-backed copyright legislation that threatens Internet freedom. Ron Paul was an early SOPA opponent, but SOPA is hardly the only example of bad copyright legislation. For example, Congress last added 20 years to copyright terms in 1998. That means we're due for another debate on extending copyright terms between now and 2018. Opponents of that inevitable proposal could use the Campaign for Liberty's support.\nMore importantly, Congress has already enacted copyright legislation that threatens Internet freedom. Perhaps the most alarming example is the 2008 PRO-IP Act, which gives the federal government the power to seize domain names, servers, and other assets of Internet companies without proving their owners have committed any crime. Libertarians have long railed against the abuse of civil asset forfeiture laws in the war on drugs. There's even more reason to be alarmed about the government using those powers to enforce copyright laws.\nIt's important to remember that the debate over Internet freedom is not strictly a left-vs-right debate. While the left and right are never going to agree on every Internet policy issue, they've frequently found common ground when Internet freedom comes under attack.\nIn particular, we don't agree with the manifesto's claim that \"openness\" is an \"Internet collectivist\" code word for \"government control of privately owned infrastructure.\" Openness is an engineering concept that is embraced by people with a wide variety of political perspectives. There are reasonable arguments against openness being mandated by the government, but there's no reason libertarians should be hostile toward openness as such.\nProtecting Internet freedom in the future will require the same kind of ideologically diverse coalition that stopped the Stop Online Piracy Act. Branding left-of-center Internet policy advocates as \"Internet collectivists\" seems unnecessarily divisive."}

{"prompt": "What is Mississippi State getting in new baseball coach Chris Lemonis?\nWhat is Mississippi State getting in Chris Lemonis? Let's talk about it.\nWith the news that Mississippi State has hired Indiana's Chris Lemonis to be its new baseball coach, Clarion Ledger sports editor Hugh Kellenberger and Indianapolis Star IU insider Zach Osterman had an email conversation about the hire and what it means for both schools.\nHugh Kellenberger: \"OK Zach, Indiana baseball coach Chris Lemonis is now the head coach at Mississippi State. I guess we should start with the basic, obvious question that most MSU fans are asking themselves today: Is this a good hire?\"\nZach Osterman: \"I think it is. Having grown up in SEC country (Y'all need to get more Publix in that state), I'm well aware of expectations at a place like Mississippi State. And while I know Lemonis doesn't necessarily have every resume trimming you'd want, he's a proven recruiter, a college baseball lifer and a guy who in four years at Indiana did things nobody else has done in the history of IU'", "baseline": "s oldest varsity program. His teams are balanced and deep, and in all four seasons, I covered him, the best way I could describe his style is that he brings a high floor virtually every year. Will his ceiling raise with time and the advantages of a Mississippi State? Obviously, I can't tell you that for sure. But I think there's every chance.\"\nKellenberger: \"That's I think the biggest question right now with Mississippi State: what is the ceiling? So Lemonis did a nice job taking the baton from Tracy Smith at Indiana and he had some success, including three regionals in four years. That's all very nice. But success at Mississippi State is not judged by trips to the regionals. It's super regionals and trips to Omaha. Lemonis has been to Omaha, albeit as an assistant at Louisville. So he knows what it takes to get there. But what do you think he has to do differently than he did at Indiana in order to unlock that higher ceiling? Or is it simply a matter of when you load the bus with better players, you're going to get better results?\"\nOsterman: \"I tend to think it's probably more the latter. Most casual college baseball fans (for understandable reasons) don't realize all the obstacles Big Ten programs face \u2014 weather, scheduling, recruiting base, prestige, restrictive recruiting rules. The conference has at least invested more in recent years, and loosening a few things up, but look at it this way: Since 2013, Indiana has made five NCAA regionals in six seasons, and one College World Series. Of those five regionals, the three Lemonis landed represent the program's three at-large berths ever. No Big Ten team since Ohio State in the mid-1990s has been in the tournament as often, and IU's World Series appearance (pre-Lemonis, I know) was the conference's first in 29 years. The point is, as much as IU baseball has improved \u2014 and it undoubtedly has \u2014 sustaining that level of success at a Big Ten program is a generational accomplishment. If you told me 36 wins a year would become 47 wins a year with the talent and advantages of a top-tier SEC program, I'd believe you. There are clear areas for Lemonis to improve. But he's done more here than a lot of folks probably realize.\"\nKellenberger: \"So let's talk about the recruiting because that's probably one of the biggest reasons why national baseball writers are liking this hire: Lemonis' reputation is that he's excellent at it, first at Louisville and then at Indiana. But there are two very different kinds of recruiting I think, especially in college baseball where you could have a very nice recruiting ranking that means very little when your whole class just used you as leverage with MLB teams and never show up on campus. So can you point to any players in Lemonis' past that are either A) Guys that he shouldn't have gotten in the first place but did, either because he kept them from blue bloods or the MLB Draft and B) Players that he \"discovered,\" for lack of a better word, and have developed into key contributors for Indiana.\"\nOsterman: \"Yea, this is a tougher one for me to judge, because there are so many layers to college baseball recruiting. When I say his teams always had high floors, that came first from solid recruiting. His staffs were deep, whether they had a true ace or not. His lineups never fell off after the four or five guy. IU admittedly sometimes lacked some of the star power of the Tracy Smith era (was there ever a Schwarber or a Travis or a Phegley?) but his teams were always, always deep. He also had some bad luck with committing guys early who took huge leaps late, and looked like the kinds of talents that would get drafted but then thrive in college, before they wound up going higher or getting greater slot money than anyone expected.\n\"He's still hit on a combination of good local recruiting -- many of Indiana's best players are either in state or regional, Illinois and Ohio -- and smart junior college additions to fill gaps created by unexpected attrition. Lemonis' reputation, as you said, precedes him as a recruiter. He'll emphasize local ties as much as possible. He's 100 percent the guy that will go to every tournament, watch every game, work 14-hour days. And like Dan McDonnell at Louisville, he'll happily commit a kid young (although he's not exclusive to that policy).\"\nKellenberger: \"Alright, last question: Where do you think Indiana goes from here? Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen made it quite clear he was going big-game hunting when he began his search, and it ended up with TCU's Jim Schlossnagle and Louisville's Dan McDonnell both publicly saying they were staying where they were and not going to Mississippi State. Part of Cohen's problem in the pursuit of those guys, I think, was that those guys just don't leave where they are. College baseball is a sport where coaches are much more apt to go to a place, build it up and then stay for the long-term. And now that salaries have risen to the point where generational wealth is at play, there's even less reason to jump into the unknown. So, from that perspective, MSU hiring someone who has been to Omaha as an assistant and has won a lot of games at the best school in a not-great baseball conference makes sense. And if Cohen got this right, then maybe Lemonis is that guy who stays 15-20 years. But if you're Indiana, what's your move? I would guess Fred Glass would want his own McDonnell, but that's easier said than done. Do any of the assistants have a chance at the gig? Does Glass look to the mid-majors for someone else on the rise and hope for the best?\"\nOsterman: \"That's an interesting question without a clear answer right now. Indiana is in this weird place where it's paying better than just about the rest of the Big Ten, and its facilities are really good, but it's still a clear step or two below say, Mississippi State in resources. Again, IU's having a generational level of success right now. If Glass, IU's AD, wants that to continue, he could easily justify taking that spending up another level and trying to get a home-run hire. Or he could do what Indiana's done the last two times the job came open: stick with someone young, up-and-coming and in the Midwest. Jeff Mercer at Wright State sort of straddles those two possibilities. Either way, I think Indiana will look external before considering the existing staff, and I think Glass will probably step up his financial commitment again. There's an argument to be made for IU basically just bridging the financial gap, paying high six figures (or more) for a head coach and making it harder for this to happen again. I think Glass would probably prefer this be his last baseball hire.\""}

Can I break the annuity contract to get my money back?\nWithout seeing your actual annuity contract, we're going to have to be a little general here.\nWhen choosing between annuitizing and surrendering your annuity contract, there are many options to consider.\nWe're glad to see you're not jumping to make a decision without asking questions.\nAlso know that owning an annuity contract does not mean that you are locked into it forever, said Michael Green, a certified financial planner with Wechter Feldman Wealth Management in Parsippany.\nThat said, a payout of $125 per month for 10 years seems extremely low for a contract of this size, he said.\nHe said there are several types of annuity payouts available to an annuitant, and it sounds like you were provided only one option.\nSome of the payout options that could be", "baseline": "available to you include: \"life,\" \"period certain,\" \"life with period certain\" and \"joint life and survivor.\"\nGreen explained what they all mean.\nA \"life\" payout will ensure that you will not outlive your payments.\n\"Period certain\" guarantees that you will be paid for a certain number of years, usually 10, 15, or 20.\n\"Life with period certain\" guarantees a payout for the number of years chosen for the period certain.\n\"If the annuitant dies during this period, the payments will continue for the remainder of the period certain,\" he said. \"If the annuitant lives beyond the period certain, then payouts will continue for their lifetime.\"\n\"Joint life and survivor\" will pay out the annuity over the lifetimes of two people, he said.\n\"Should you decide to annuitize, your selection of a payout option is final,\" Green said. \"Therefore, you should confirm that these payout amounts are accurately quoted before making any decisions. The more risk the insurance company takes, the lower your payout will be.\"\nIf you have considered all payout options and determined that none of them are in line with your financial goals, you may also consider liquidating your annuity to receive a lump sum distribution, Green said.\n\"It is important to keep in mind, however, that there may be additional tax consequences associated with surrendering your contract,\" he said. \"If the surrender period for your policy has already expired, you can liquidate or 'break' the annuity contract with no penalty.\"\nBut the taxation and flexibility of your withdrawal options depend on the classification of your annuity. Specifically, is the annuity qualified or non-qualified?\nGreen said a qualified annuity may be eligible for a tax deduction when purchased, but would be subject to income tax upon distribution. A non-qualified annuity is funded with after-tax dollars, and when withdrawals are taken, only the earnings are taxable.\nIn short, you have options -- but it can be easy to choose the wrong one.\nAnd, Green said, it is extremely important to know what you are getting into before signing on the dotted line.\n\"When making an irreversible decision, such as the type of annuity payout to receive, be sure to explore any potential unintended consequences,\" he said. \"For example, it is possible that you could unknowingly lose the death benefit of your policy if the wrong choice is made.\"\nHe said you should think about working with a qualified professional before making your final decision.\n\"The best option is the one that's right for you -- not the insurance company,\" Green said."}
{"prompt": "A British-born sailor presumed lost at sea was not wearing a safety tether when he was knocked overboard during a yacht race, it has been revealed.\nJohn Fisher, who lived in Adelaide, Australia, plunged into the Southern Ocean, around 1,400 miles west of Cape Horn, during the Volvo Ocean Race on Monday.\nOfficials of the round-the-world race say the team searched for several hours in high wind and big waves, although deteriorating conditions forced the crew to resume course toward South America.\nFellow crew from Team Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag said Mr Fisher had unclipped his tether to tidy up a sheet when the boat was caught in an accidental crash gybe - where the mainsail and its supporting boom swing across to the opposite side of the vessel.\nAccording to a timeline of events released by the team, Mr Fisher was hit by the mainsheet system and knocked overboard. The crew believe he was already unconscious from the blow before hitting the water.\nThe 47-year-old, who was an experienced big boat sailor and", "baseline": "was sailing in his first Volvo Ocean Race, was wearing a survival suit with a wetsuit hood and gloves and a lifejacket at the time.\nTeam manager Tim Newton described it as \"the worst situation you can imagine happening to your team\".\nHe added: \"We are absolutely heart-broken for John's family and friends. I know for David (Witt, the boat's skipper), he has lost his best friend. It's devastating.\"\nFollowing the incident, it took some time to get the boat under control and sail back to a position near where Mr Fisher had been thrown overboard.\nA search and rescue operation was carried out for several hours, but there was no sign of the sailor, and the decision was made to abandon the search as weather conditions deteriorated.\nThe crew are now making their way back to shore.\n\"This situation isn't over yet for our team,\" said Mr Newton. \"The conditions are extremely challenging, with strong winds and a forecast for a building sea state over the next couple of days.\n\"Our sole focus, with the assistance of Race Control in Alicante is to get the team into port safely.\n\"Once we have achieved that, we have time to de-brief more fully and ensure that any lessons that can be learned from what happened to John are incorporated by the rest of the fleet going forward.\n\"That would be a tremendous legacy for John, who spent so much of his time passing the learnings from his lifetime of experience at sea onto the younger sailors on our team.\"\nEarlier in the race, Scallywag crewman Alex Gough was swept overboard during a sail change and was rescued within seven minutes.\nMr Gough was not wearing a safety harness or life jacket, and skipper David Witt said at the time that he was lucky to be alive.\nIn May 2006, Dutch sailor Hans Horrevoets was swept overboard in the Atlantic Ocean. The crew turned back and found Mr Horrevoets but could not revive him.\nThis edition of the race had already been tarnished by a collision involving Vestas 11th Hour Racing and a fishing boat that killed a fisherman in January.\nThe collision off Hong Kong sank the fishing boat and caused severe damage to the racing yacht, forcing it to miss the next two legs.\nThe entire race covers some 45,000 nautical miles."}
{"prompt": "The gloves are off in the fight over the shape of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nA showdown in Salzburg in Austria punctured the unreal bubble of collusion that had endured since the Brexit referendum in 2016.\nThe messy break-up of the European summit on Thursday revealed both sides are entering the next phase as punch-drunk protagonists swinging wildly, with no clear idea of the end point.\nTo the dismay of those who cherish international systems and institutions, it is now clear that Brexit won\u2019t settle the argument over Europe\u2019s future. Instead it now threatens to set up the long-range break up of the continent.\nThe Brexit argument that the overarching politics of Europe is self-interested and unbending is now unanswerable.\nPoliticians steadily losing their grasp on their own politics on Thursday rallied for the cheap thrill of knocking down the vulnerable British leader.\nEmmanuel Macron, who has alienated more French people than he has won over, lead the sneer-fest, kicking at \u201c", "baseline": "the liars\u201d responsible for Brexit.\nRiding shotgun was Angela Merkel, the veteran German leader who now barely clings to the chancellor\u2019s office. Enfeebled, she spent last week failing to sack a German domestic intelligence supremo who consorted with the far-right and rubbished her version of a race-hate protest.\nIn the end the spymaster was promoted, not ousted.\nVirtually every one of the heads of government gathered in Austria could be found wanting in this fashion.\nYet these men and women are the custodians of Europe. At the table, which was visually reminiscent of a villain's lair in a James Bond movie, the group decided to rough house Theresa May\u2019s carefully modest proposal for a Brexit that was not horrendously disruptive.\nThe summit resembled nothing so much as a giant act of collective displacement to camouflage the real issue. This is a European culture war that is centred on immigration.\nThere is broadly a split between the most developed countries and those with less dynamic economies.\nAppropriately for the Salzburg setting, the dividing line is currently centred on the Tyrolean countries (Germany, Austria and Italy) but shifting ever further north and west.\nUnfortunately for Mrs May, the moment of clarity over the Brexit negotiations heightens her domestic difficulties. As her motorcade travelled to Downing Street on Friday, the British prime minister was frantically pulling together her response.\nOn Friday, newspaper front pages screamed \u201chumiliation\". It felt like she was an ambush victim. A day later, the headline writers were defiantly behind Mrs May.\nFor what choice did she have but to stand firm? While the split screen showed the pound falling on the foreign exchanges, she made two clear statements of resolve. She would not offer concessions on the Irish border as the price of Brexit and she demanded serious consideration of a trade partnership that would not congeal the western European economy.\nYet the grenade-throwers who scorn a negotiated Brexit, both in Europe and in Britain, are freshly emboldened.\nThere is much pointless talk, including by some of the European leaders indulging in idle speculation, about a second referendum to keep Britain in Europe on the current terms.\nThe cavalier and dogmatic approach that Europeans have shown towards the British has alienated swathes of moderate opinion. As a result of not being listened to by the other side, the Brexit world view has a growing credibility.\nThe history of Europe is one of coming together because the collective group gave shelter from geopolitical ravages. A vision of close and neighbourly partnership is a tricky proposition when an acrimonious divorce is on the table.\nThe British must now bear the consequences of having thrown down their defences and almost all strategic advantages in the Brexit process.\nThe one certainty \u2013 that Britain would leave the EU at the end of March \u2013 must now be in doubt. Shifts will be quick and transformational. Lurking in the wings is the Marxist Labour Party.\nIt is possible that Mrs May will be unseated by a Conservative revolt when her party meets for its annual conference next week. Alternatively, she can capitulate and accept a new strategy.\nIt is possible that the complete breakdown of the talks will happen next month. It might not be possible for the two sides to even agree a temporary deal to keep ports open when Britain leaves.\nIf there is a divorce, agreeing the trade deal \u2013 which is supposed to kick in during 2020 \u2013 might never happen. Europe might just have said \"auf weidersehen\" to Britain."}

Police say conditions in the house caused by the grow-ops, such as mould spores, could be injurious or dangerous to public health.\nThe same could be done with buildings that have been treated for bedbugs, Broughton said, so people are more aware of their surroundings.\nPlus, it would also give emergency workers a better idea of precautions they need to take, he said.\n\"We think government needs to take a stronger approach on these issues,\" Broughton said. \"The bedbugs are exploding in our city. No one wants to take their work home with them.\"\nHealth officials are currently putting together a province-wide response plan to deal with the bedbug invasion, Premier Greg Selinger said Monday. It will include a public awareness campaign and new ways to kill the pests.\nBroughton added there has only been a handful of instances where paramedics have spotted bedbugs on their equipment after treating a patient. That equipment and clothing had to be decontaminated before being used again.\nAlex Forrest, president of the United Fire Fighters of Winnipeg, said several firefighters have also been bitten by bedbugs during the course of their work.\n\"It's become another hazard of the job that we're being exposed,\" Forrest said. \"All you can do is educate people to minimize the risk, because it really doesn't matter where you go, a movie theatre or restaurant or hotel, you can be exposed. All it takes is one person to bring in a couple of bedbugs and increase the risk.\"\nCity police have also said they're also worried about unwittingly picking up bedbugs on calls.

{"prompt": "A new study by researchers at The Kinsey Institute and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has found that the timeless, multicultural tradition of grandmothering might have an unexpected benefit: helping some women temper their hot flashes and night sweats during menopause.\nThe researchers, two clinicians and a bioanthropologist, examined how close relationships can help women in midlife with this inevitable change - with the clinicians looking for therapeutic benefits that might help patients deal with this unpredictable, poorly understood transition, and the bioanthropologist predicting an evolutionary connection. Their study, which focused on the relationship between mid-life women and young children, found that women who underwent rapid menopause, caused by the surgical removal of ovaries, had fewer hot flashes and night sweats when young children lived in their homes.\nThe study was published in Menopause: the Journal of the North American Menopause Society. Study authors are Tierney Lorenz, postdoctoral fellow at The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University Bloomington, Bonnie A McGregor, researcher at University of Washington's Hutchinson", "baseline": "Cancer Research Center, and Virginia J. Vitzthum, professor of anthropology and senior research scientist at The Kinsey Institute.\nThe study involved 117 participants in the study; 69 women were menopausal or postmenopausal at the time of their surgery, with 29 of them having at least one child at home, and 48 women were premenopausal, with 28 of them having at least one child at home. Researchers measured hot flashes and night sweats just before the surgery and then again at two months, six months and 12 months post-surgery.\n\"These are intriguing findings,\" Lorenz said. \"For women who were menopausal when our study began, those with young children at home actually showed more symptoms of hot flashes. But the women who underwent rapid menopause because of the surgical removal of their ovaries showed a dramatic reduction of symptoms.\"\nThe process of menopause, when ovaries no longer produce eggs and menstruation stops, varies widely. Some women have almost no bothersome symptoms, while some women experience almost crippling symptoms. Lorenz said a small subset of women experience very severe effects longer than would be expected.\nThe numerous studies on menopause have generated little consensus, Lorenz said, leaving women with a wide range of questionable treatments, such as supplements, hormonal treatments and even hot yoga. This new study is one of the first involving social interaction and menopause symptoms to control for the age of the women and also for the type of relationship - only relationships with young children were considered.\nThe study got its start with Vitzthum's interest in the evolutionary role of social structures - grandmothering in this case. The institution of grandmothering can be seen across cultures, but is it really necessary for the survival of the species? Is there an immediate benefit to the women? Is it a coincidence that women often undergo the physiological change of menopause at an age when they might have young grandchildren on hand?\nLorenz cautioned that the findings of their study cannot be generalized to all women, particularly since menopause affects women so differently. But they point to a need to examine the hormone oxytocin more carefully because of its possible role in the results. Oxytocin is associated with nurturing care and a wide range of effects across the body, including interactions involved in regulating body temperature. It also can affect mood and sleeping patterns, which can be disturbed during menopause. She also thinks it is significant that the benefits only involved young children.\n\"The fact the effects observed were limited to only women with children younger than 13 years suggests that parity was not sufficient to produce changes in flashes and points instead to the increased nurturance needs of young children,\" the authors wrote in the journal article. \"Presence of young children at home may moderate development of hot flashes during the menopausal transition.\"\nThe research was supported by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\nIndiana University. \"Having young children in the house may lessen menopausal symptoms.\" Medical News Today.

Arizona State Sun Devils defeated Utah Utes 30-10. (Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune) Utah Utes quarterback Troy Williams (3) talks with Utah Utes quarterback Tyler Huntley (1) during the game at Rice-Eccles Stadium Saturday, October 21, 2017. Arizona State Sun Devils defeated Utah Utes 30-10.\nA roar went up from every corner of Rice-Eccles Stadium when Tyler Huntley took the field with the Utes offense for the first time in almost a month. The noise wasn\u2019t just palpable, it was audible.\nThen reality sunk in as Huntley\u2019s return failed to produce a revival for the Utes\u2019 offense. Huntley struggled so mightily that it begs the question: Did Huntley\u2019s return do more to hurt than to help?\nHuntley, the sophomore quarterback, wowed with his playmaking ability with both his legs and his arm in the first three games of the season. The first-year starter suffered a shoulder injury against Arizona in the Pac-12 opener, and he\u2019d been sidelined since.\nIn light of back-to-back losses, albeit by a total of four points, there seemed to be a sentiment among Utes fans that Huntley\u2019s return would provide a necessary jolt. Some might even have argued that his presence might have changed the outcome of the previous losses.\nHuntley, facing a defense which had two interceptions in six games, completed 19 of 35 passes for 155 yards with four interceptions. His fourth interception, which came with the Utes down 23-3 in the fourth quarter, got returned 20 yards for a touchdown.\nPassing: 23 of 32, 227 yards, 1 TD, 1 Int.\nPassing: 30 of 43, 341 yards, 4 TDS, 1 Int.\nPassing: 19 of 35, 155 yards, 4 Ints.\nThe Utes\u2019 10 points were their fewest since scoring nine in a loss to UCLA in 2015. They managed 265 yards of total offense, and their longest play of the day was 17 yards.\nHuntley showed no obvious signs of his injury hampering him. His throwing arm did hang limply at his side for a moment immediately after getting hit on his arm in mid-throwing motion late in the first half. The next play he tossed an off-target throw up the sideline for his second interception of the first half.\nHuntley didn\u2019t want to use his shoulder or his lack of practice time in recent weeks as excuses, and he repeatedly came back to the offensive mistakes as the reason for the poor showing."}

The company recently completed its goals for the initial Stinger project, on which it began work in 2012 and which the company claims improved the performance of Hive by 100 times while also improving its functionality.\nThe company explains the details of how it, along with the Hadoop community, plans to pull this off in a blog post on Wednesday.

But it\u2019s also true that a more-capable Hive is going to look very appealing to a lot of users that have been using Hive for years and don\u2019t want to incorporate an entirely new technology (although Stinger.next does involve some major architectural changes), or that prefer their Hadoop components to be as open as possible.\nI\u2019m not sure running SQL jobs on Hadoop is the ultimate use case for what many claim will be a revolutionary data platform, but given the size of the database market, it\u2019s potentially a lucrative one and it\u2019s helping highlight some big differences between each vendor\u2019s approach to selling Hadoop.\nI would recommend updating your piece to reflect that Impala is (and has been) an open source project, freely available on github .

Arizona will then send Johnson and another minor league pitcher to the Dodgers. The Yankees will then send righty Javier Vazquez and two minor league prospects (catcher Dioner Navarro and third baseman Eric Duncan) to the Dodgers.\nFinally, the Dodgers will ship Johnson and probably left-hander Kaz Ishii to the Yankees to complete the deal.

One, there is a lot of deferred money with several players that needs to be ironed out. Two, several of the key players \u2013 Johnson and Penny, in particular \u2013 have to undergo and pass physicals. And three, multiple no-trade clauses \u2013 with Johnson and Green \u2013 have to be figured out.\nFinally, the deal has to go to commissioner Bud Selig to be approved. Once Selig approves it, likely on Monday, then a 72-hour window will open for the Yankees to talk to Johnson and the Diamondbacks to talk to Green about extensions. Both players have no-trade clauses and have only one year remaining on their contracts.\nIt will take at least a week to get everything all cleared up. Still, even Penny himself told ESPN Radio yesterday the deal is nearing completion, and he\u2019s on track to have a physical with the Diamondbacks next week.\nAt one point yesterday, the Yankees believed there could be a fourth team involved in the trade, possibly either Baltimore, St. Louis or the White Sox. But now it\u2019s believed there is no fourth team needed, unless the Dodgers want to move Vazquez in another deal.\nBarring something unforeseen, the trade should eventually be completed. Once it is, it will allow the Yankees to go from having a shaky rotation to sporting arguably the best five-man unit in the game \u2013 Johnson, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano, Jaret Wright and Kevin Brown (if he is not traded).

He proceeded to punt", "baseline": "the ball in celebration.\n\"I didn\u2019t mean no disrespect or anything like that,\" Butler said. \"That\u2019s just who I am.

He competes at everything he does. He wants to win at everything he does, he wants to win at every rep and he wants to let you know when he beats you. And I love that about Malcolm.\"\nButler forced at least one turnover in each of the first four practices of training camp. On Saturday, he provided one of the few highlights from the Titans practice at Nissan Stadium, flashing good closing speed to get his hand on a pass intended for Taywan Taylor and break it up.\n\"I\u2019ve seen everything that I thought he was going to be and that\u2019s being a fiery competitor, scraping and working hard every single day,\" safety Kevin Byard said. \"I feel like he\u2019s been the most impressive defensive player so far in camp. He\u2019s been out here fighting and clawing, earning that contract.\"\nLike all those Super Bowl questions, Butler uses a repeated answer to inquiries about his intensity in practice."}
{"prompt": "A Sino-American summit that would discuss American arms sales to Taiwan and other issues including global strategy seems a possibility following Vice-Chairman Deng Xiaoping's expression of interest in meeting President Reagan.\nMr. Deng, China's de facto leader, raised the possibility during a meeting with visiting United States Sen. Howard Baker. As Senate majority leader, Mr. Baker works closely with President Reagan.\nSenator Baker told a press conference here June 2 that he had been ''especially pleased to hear Vice-Chairman Deng say he would like to meet with President Reagan, and indeed he asked me to convey this message to President Reagan. . . .'' He said the details were not for him to arrange but for the President and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.\nThe atmosphere of Sino-American relations has improved following Vice-President George Bush's visit to China early last month. But the difficult problem of American arms sales to Taiwan still ''ticks'' away, in Chinese words, like a ''time bomb.'' Hitherto it had been assumed that President Reagan would not visit China until the arms sales issue has been dis", "baseline": "posed of.\nNow it appears that Mr. Deng, whose formal position is vice-chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (Mr. Deng's protege Hu Yaobang is chairman) would welcome a chance to talk directly to President Reagan about the Taiwan question and other issues.\nSenator Baker said he also raised the case of the detention of Lisa Wichser, an American graduate student employed by the Chinese government as a teacher of English in Peking, with Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Wenjin June 1. Miss Wichser, who is working for a PhD in agricultural economics from the University of Denver, has been accused of having violated Chinese laws and of ''activities incompatible with her status,'' according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman here.\nMr. Baker said he did not know all the details of the case but that he had been assured by the Chinese that they would strictly follow the terms of the Sino-American consular convention. He hoped Miss Wichser would be allowed to leave China as soon as possible.\nChina wants an American commitment to reduce and ultimately stop Taiwan arms sales altogether. It argues that continued sales violate China's sovereignty.\nPresident Reagan, who campaigned for office saying he would upgrade relations with Taiwan and give the islanders more and better weapons, has gradually changed his position. He now takes greater account of the importance of the strategic relationship between China and the United States in facing the Soviet Union. Since taking office he has restricted arms sales to Taiwan to $60 million worth of spare parts.\nBut he remains constrained by the Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress in April l979 following normalization of relations between Washington and Peking. This act provides for the US to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons for self-defense.\nDoes the act give the President the latitude to sell or not sell arms to Taiwan, or to cease arms sales altogether? Senator Baker seemed to think that the act as written leaves implementation in the hands of the president with the consent of Congress. Thus there is no need to amend the act, as amendment would also be politically extremely difficult.\nHowever, in his conversation with Mr. Baker June 1 Mr. Deng apparently raised for the first time the possibility of amending the act. Mr. Baker told him he would convey Mr. Deng's remarks not only to the President and to Mr. Haig but also to his senatorial colleagues. However Mr. Baker said he himself did not favor an amendment of the act."}

{"prompt": "What the Hell Is Happening in Iran?\nIranian students protest at the University of Tehran during a demonstration driven by anger over economic problems. Students were outnumbered by counterdemonstrators, however, as videos on social media showed.\nAnti-government protests continued across multiple cities in Iran for a fourth day on Sunday, the most widespread unrest in the country since the pro-democracy Green Movement in 2009 \u2014 though nowhere near the same scale thus far. Two protesters were killed overnight Saturday, the first deaths attributed to the unrest. On Sunday, authorities reportedly blocked Instagram and the popular messaging app Telegram, which Iranians have been using to spread news about the protests. The country\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard has threatened a violent crackdown if the demonstrations continue.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, in remarks which were aired on state television on Sunday night, supported Iranians\u2019 right to protest and criticize the government, and indicated that some of the protesters had legitimate demands but that protests should not include violence or anti-regime slogans.\nThe unrest", "baseline": "began with a protest in Iran\u2019s second-largest city, Mashhad, on Thursday, apparently led by hard-liners who wanted to voice their opposition to the reformist policies of President Rouhani. Protests don\u2019t always go as planned in Iran, however, since people sometimes take advantage of the rare opportunity to express dissent publicly, regardless of the original organizers\u2019 intentions. That seems to be what happened in Mashhad, as an anti-Rouhani protest morphed into a broader anti-regime one, decrying rising prices, corruption, and Iran\u2019s foreign-policy expenditures in places like Syria and Lebanon.\nThe protests, publicized on the popular messaging app Telegram and subsequently reported on by foreign-based satellite news networks, then quickly spread to other cities across the country on Friday, including Tehran, other major cities, and a surprising number of smaller cities that don\u2019t typically see such demonstrations. As the protests spread, many took on an even harsher anti-regime tone, with slogans calling for the downfall of the country\u2019s supreme leader and Islamic government. The seemingly spontaneous, often provincial, protests varied in size, with some resulting in violent clashes with police. Scores have reportedly been arrested throughout the country.\nThe apparently leaderless protests continued on Saturday, despite the government\u2019s warning against participating in \u201cillegal gatherings.\u201d Violence was reported at rallies in several cities as police and plainclothes security officers continued to try to suppress the unrest. Two protesters were killed by gunfire in the western city of Dorud, but local officials denied that security forces were responsible for the deaths, characteristically blaming Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers instead.\nAlso on Saturday, pro-government protesters took to the streets in Tehran and other cities to participate in a preplanned celebration of the anniversary of the crackdown on the Green Movement. So far, there has not been a similar crackdown in response to this new outbreak, but that could change fast. One of the leaders of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard told state media on Saturday that protesters would face \u201cthe nation\u2019s iron fist\u201d if the unrest continued, and internet access to Instagram and Telegram were blocked on Sunday in an attempt to cut off information about the protests.\nOther reports indicate that the internet was also throttled in Tehran and cut off entirely in Mashhad.\nAs The Guardian and New York Times point out, small protests focused on economic issues are normal in Iran, but politically charged protests across the country where people feel safe chanting \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d \u2014 a knock on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \u2014 are not. The protests will undoubtedly be an important test for the relatively moderate Rouhani, who has not been spared as a subject of chanting at the rallies; in his remarks on Sunday, Rouhani was clearly trying to walk a delicate line. There is also apparently suspicion among members of his administration and other reformers about what forces may be behind the unrest.\nSome experts aren\u2019t surprised at the sudden wave of protests, however, noting the economic discontent created by the ongoing rise of the cost of living and the unemployment rate in the country.\nThe Trump administration, which has sought to undo President Obama\u2019s diplomatic progress with Iran and has even flirted with fantasies of promoting regime change, criticized Iran\u2019s government on Friday and urged it to allow the protests to continue. Calling for restraint against peaceful protests is the standard response to unrest in Iran from any administration, though this White House has added some Trumpian flare.\nPresident Trump then revisited the subject in more tweets on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, but such support is probably more useful to the regime than it ever is to protesters, particularly since Trump has already made it easier for the regime to use the U.S. as a scapegoat for its internal problems by threatening to cancel the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions. Indeed, nothing Trump has done since taking office has indicated he or his administration has any real concern for the citizens of Iran.\nRegarding what will happen next in Iran, most experts aren\u2019t sure, especially since this new movement, if that\u2019s what it is, does not appear to have any leaders to guide it. As The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Farnaz Fassihi points out, the lack of leadership, structure, and goals is exactly why previous uprisings have typically failed.\nThe Iranian government, as it has in the past, is working to block social-media platforms used by protesters, but there are still more ways than ever before for reports and videos about the protests \u2014 as well as any subsequent crackdown \u2014 to spread. In addition, if the regime cuts off or drastically slows down internet access as it did in 2009, that would likely have a much more dramatic effect on the country\u2019s businesses and citizens now that the internet is more widely used and relied upon.\nThere has also been some tentative support for the protests from hard-liners, who seem to want the unrest to tarnish Rouhani, and that has caused some Iranians to worry the protests are being encouraged as a regime plot to draw out and capture opposition activists. Many anti-regime protesters faced long and brutal imprisonment after being arrested during the Green Movement, and a few hundred may have been killed.\nAs always, regime-change cheerleaders in the West should probably temper their expectations and refrain from projecting their views onto the protesters. But if the unrest continues, spreads, and increases in size \u2014 possibly prompting a violent crackdown by regime security forces \u2014 it could quickly lead to a new political crisis in the country at a time when it already faces a resurgent regional rival in Saudi Arabia and a U.S. administration that seems reflexively anti-Iran.\nIs it a revolution? Not yet. Iran\u2019s government is its own worst enemy and the Iranian people know it. Economic woes leading to infighting can bring down this corrupt and brutal system. Different factions within the government will, most probably, and just the same as always, choose to dismiss the genuine economic grievances of the Iranian people and blame the protests on foreign agents and an international imperialist-Zionist conspiracy.\nThe Iranian people have learned, after living almost 40 years under the Islamic Republic, to gradually and intelligently raise their voices in peaceful protests that will provoke the government to tear itself apart. Iran\u2019s rulers may choose to blame foreigners and Zionists \u2014 but they hardly realize that the true danger to their power is right at home.\nAlong similar lines, NIAC research director Reza Marashi, who worked in the Office of Iranian Affairs for the State Department under the Obama administration, adds that the current political climate in Iran does not appear conducive to massive change, but that the gap between state and society will remain \u2014 making protest waves like the present one possible \u2014 so long as the political, economic, and social aspirations of the Iranian people remain unmet.\nThis post has been updated throughout to reflect new developments and commentary."}

{"prompt": "President Obama seems so shell-shocked from all the political and media criticism about his \u201cweakness\u201d that he is \u201cdoing something\u201d by intervening in both the Syrian and Iraqi civil conflicts, a risky \u201cbias for action\u201d that can do more harm than good, as ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar explains.\nA \u201cbias for action\u201d has long been a buzz phrase in the business world. Tom Peters and Robert Waterman in their best-selling book In Search of Excellence put the phrase at the top of their list of attributes of what they considered to be outstanding firms.\nFor an individual hoping to make it big in business, it\u2019s not a bad phrase to keep in mind. Ambitious executives do not make names for themselves by saying they will take whatever organization they are responsible for and try not to screw it up. They make names by shaking things up. Moreover, the businesses with the most dramatic and admired garage-startup-to-behemoth histories necessarily had a bias for action.\nEven in business, however, the behavior implied by the phrase has limitations. What is", "baseline": "good for the rising career of an individual executive is not necessarily good for the firm. And for every Apple or Amazon we have heard about, there are many more companies we have not heard about in which the leader\u2019s bias for action led to unprofitable business lines, financial overextension, or other failures that caused the firm to crash and burn.\nApplied to foreign policy, the soundness of behavior implied by a bias for action is even more questionable. Perhaps it is most valid when trying to build an empire. Otto von Bismarck, for example, had a bias for action when using wars against other European states as a means for putting together the German Empire.\nBut for most states at most times, that is not the case. It is not the case for the United States today. The United States has a responsibility, to itself as well as to world order, less to build a bigger empire than to avoid screwing things up. And when the United States screws up, things can get very bad, not only because as the world\u2019s only superpower it is more powerful than anyone else but also because with global involvement it has a lot of vulnerabilities that other states do not have. Crashing and burning is not an option.\nEven without the influence of business gurus such as Peters and Waterman, a bias for action is nonetheless at least as apparent in U.S. foreign policy as in commerce. One reason is the political pressure on leaders to be seen to be \u201cdoing something\u201d about overseas problems. The partisan incentive to criticize opponents for doing nothing intensifies this pressure. In the United States the tendency is further exacerbated by a broader inclination to believe the United States ought to be able to solve any problem overseas.\nWe need to remember that a bias for action is exactly that: a bias. That means it is antithetical to an objective, unbiased assessment of what would be best for the United States to do or not to do. And that is not good. A bias for action has some of the qualities of the \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d method of approaching a problem.\nWe can see some of these tendencies in the development of recent policy toward the turmoil in Iraq. The Obama administration\u2019s dispatch of a few hundred U.S. military personnel, although they will be serving legitimate purposes, is probably best understood as a response to the pressure to do something. It probably was the minimum military measure the administration could get away with without incurring intense accusations of doing nothing.\nI was asked the other day to define U.S. objectives regarding the situation in Iraq. There are two ways to answer a question like that. One is the conventional way, which is the way any president or senior official would be expected to answer it. That way would mention things such as seeking regional stability and quashing terrorist threats against Americans.\nThe other way is to ask ourselves what are the most significant respects in which U.S. interests have been affected, for better or for worse, by developments in the Middle East over the past decade or so. Then our objective should be to repeat or build on what has affected our interests for the better, and to avoid repetition of the sorts of things that have affected them for the worse.\nBy far the most consequential development for U.S. interests in the region was the Iraq War, and its effects on U.S. interests were overwhelmingly negative, with the thousands of Americans killed, the tens of thousands injured, the trillions of dollars in economic costs, and the stimulation of sectarian warfare and terrorism that we face today. The number one objective for dealing with a situation like the one in Iraq is to avoid doing anything that could lead to a mistake similar to launching the Iraq War.\nNo president, of course, could get away with defining U.S. objectives that way. It would sound too passive, and it would not embody a bias for action. It would not pass muster with Peters and Waterman, and it certainly would not pass muster with political critics.\nThat\u2019s too bad, because it is a very legitimate way to define a prime objective. It takes account of the most important ways in which U.S. interests have been affected, and it takes account of how in any unbiased analysis of how to pursue and protect those interests there is no reason either action or inaction should be favored.\nSay all of the right things, but take the easy way out, has been the American way.\nIf a prophetic gift is the gift of truth telling, Dylan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got it.\nA common reaction to ignorance and the lack of intelligent investigation and lack of any real attempt to understand\u2026 all of which can be laid at the base of lack of sensitivity for others and the failure of humanity to demand action to correct these inequities and injustices.\nI wonder \u2013 will we ever become civilized or just accept the veneer? The worrying part is that all this hypocrisy is out in the open the past 2 decades if not more and the American public just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care.\nThe guy is gutless! He hasn\u2019t done anything to bring peace to the world. He sits behind his big desk, (probably admiring his, oh so well deserved, nobel peace prize) in the bomb shelter they call \u201cthe white house\u201d, and bravely orders the deaths of anybody he wants. I would say he deserves a motorcade through Dallas, but that\u2019s a trip for a President with real balls! I\u2019ll never see another real leader, like that one, in my life time.\nIt may all be too late, but President Obama needs different people around him. I mean to tell you, as most of you consortiumnews readers already know, how our country needs to shed our government of the Neocon\u2019s, etc type people. Oh, did I mention the Main Stream Media? Are they not something to write home about? Sometimes I just come away believing we are just flat out screwed."}

Renovations commenced on the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex, and half way through the first season they officially stepped onto the ice for the first time in their new home.\nIt took a couple of seasons to fully settle in \u2013 the most recent of which saw the Generals paint the bleachers in their characteristic blue and gold \u2013 but they\u2019re happy with the way the community has embraced them.\nNot that there aren\u2019t still changes they\u2019d like to see in the area of support.\nSenior hockey is always a struggle financially, given the leagues are \u201cworking mens leagues\u201d and they\u2019re not able to play as many games or promote themselves in the way major junior teams and other levels might.\nEven this year, the Generals played at the start of March, and didn\u2019t take the ice at home for fans until March 31, which he said is \u201cdevastating\u201d in terms of keeping them relevant.\nHowever, the 2019 Viking Projects Allan Cup promises to have packed stands every night, and they\u2019re down to about 150 tickets left per game, so those looking to purchase at the door ahead of the games may want to get there early if they don\u2019t want to purchase in advance.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be down to slim pickings. There\u2019s not a lot left,\u201d said McInnis.\nFortunately, should any games be sold out, the Molson Canadian Hockey House, which will be located in the Freightliner of Red Deer Curling Complex next door to the arena, will have three large projection screens displaying the broadcast of the games and the TSN final.\nFor more details, visit www.allancup.ca.\nThe Innisfail Eagles are making history, appearing at the Allan Cup tournament for the first time in the franchise\u2019s 71 years.\nAnd they\u2019re looking to make up for both their Allan Cup Hockey West finals and Hockey Alberta Provincial Senior AAA finals losses which came at the Lacombe Generals.\nInnisfail finished third in ACHW standings in the regular season with a 9-8-0-1 record, and made it to the ACHW finals where they were swept by the Generals 3-0 in a best-of-five series.\nInnisfail then had to duke it out with the Stony Plain Eagles in a best-of-seven provincial semifinal, where they bested their opponents four games to two, including a 5-4 overtime victory in Game 6 to secure an Allan Cup berth. In the provincial final, however, they came up short, losing by an aggregate score of 7-4 to Lacombe (See Page 13 for more).\nThe team may not be on home ice, but they\u2019re sure to have a numerous fans in the stands at every game \u2013 especially considering their roster features a pair of Lacombe brothers in Blair and Taylor Mulder.\nThe Eagles will be forced to practice in Red Deer ahead of the tournament, as the ice is being taken out in their home arena. They will play in the opening game of the tournament on April 8 against the Rosetown Red Wings at 4 p.m.\nA year ago, the Rosetown Red Wings were the hosts of the Allan Cup tournament and came up short with a 0-1-2-0 record that saw them fall in the quarterfinals.\nThis year, as the Saskatchewan representatives, they\u2019ll look to not just improve upon that, but go all the way and win their first Allan Cup.\nIn the regular season, the Red Wings and Lacombe Generals fought for first place in ACHW standings all year, with their 11-7-0-0 record and +10 goal differential being edged by Lacombe\u2019s 10-6-0-2 record and +12 goal differential for top spot.\nIn ACHW playoffs, the Red Wings were bounced in the first round by the Innisfail Eagles 3-0 in a best-of-five series.\nRosetown last made the finals in 2012 where they were defeated 4-1 by the South East Prairie Thunder, and they also participated in the 2013 tournament hosted by the Bentley Generals in Red Deer.\nThe South East Prairie Thunder, like the Lacombe Generals, are also no strangers to the Allan Cup, making their seventh straight appearance at the tournament, and so it\u2019s only fitting the two teams will play each other first in the tournament on April 8.\nThe Prairie Thunder, who are based in Steinbach, Man., have made nine total appearances at the tournament. Their first was in 2009, where they made it all the way to the final, but were bested 4-3 in double overtime to the then-Bentley Generals.\nThey won their first Allan Cup in 2012 where they defeated the Rosetown Redwings 4-1. Their second Allan Cup came in 2015, where they shutout Bentley 2-0.\nThey were also finalists in 2016.\nThis year, they punched their ticket to the tournament by sweeping the Ste. Anne Aces in their best-of-three Hockey Manitoba Provincial Senior AAA finals series, including a 4-3 double overtime victory and a 4-0 shutout.\nThe Stoney Creek Generals, who hail from a community in Hamilton, Ont., are just six years old, but already are trying to do what no team has done in over 30 years \u2013 win the Allan Cup in back-to-back years.\nLast year, the team won the Allan Cup for the first time, defeating the Lacombe Generals 7- 4 in the final.\nThis year, they\u2019ll make their fourth consecutive appearance at the tournament after winning the Allan Cup Hockey league\u2019s regular season with an 18-5-1 record, and sweeping the Whitby Dunlops 4-0 in a the best-of-seven Roberston Cup finals series.\nStoney Creek\u2019s first game of the tournament will be on Tuesday, April 9 against the Innisfail Eagles at 4 p.m. They will play the Rosetown Redwings at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10.\nThe Haut-Madawaska Panthers will not only be representing their own community of St. Francois de Madawaksa in New Brunswick, but the entire Atlantic region at the Allan Cup as Newfoundland and Labrador chose not to send a representative this year.\nThe team plays in the Circuit de Hockey Senior Roger-Lizotte, and were the 2017-18 playoff champions. This year, they fell in semifinals to the St. Quentin Castors four games to three in a best-of-seven series, but had a 21-5-0-2 record in the regular season.\nThe Panthers have no prior Allan Cup tournament history.\nFor more information on the tournament and schedule, visit www.allancup.ca."}

Clearly they have failed to do that. We have been encouraging them to have a serious dialogue with the various ethnic groups which compose their population. They haven't done that. The electoral laws that they've passed for the election later this fall we believe will not lead to a credible result. Just taking generals out of uniform and making them civilians is not enough. Part of the challenge with Burma is also working more collaboratively with other countries some of whom do have strong relations with Burma. To settle on a common approach and then see if we can't together demonstrate to Burma there are definitely things that they have to do.\nInner City Press: You mean India as well as China?\nInner City Press: There's this call for an international inquiry into war crimes in Burma which was made by the UN rapporteur. France has just said there's going pursue it in this GA.

For a woman in the 1850s, it was the latter: In \"The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell\" by William Klaber, Lucy futilely wished she was a man.\nOn the morning when she cut her hair, donned her brother's clothes, and slipped from her parents' house before daybreak, Lucy Slater left more than a wretched life behind.\nShe also left her daughter, Helen, which tore her heart. Still, the decision to flee wasn't difficult.\nThree years prior, Lucy's husband abandoned his family, leaving them with nothing and forcing them to live with Lucy's parents.

Do students agree with the authors\u2019 assertion that \u201cWe can accept the reality of humanity\u2019s reshaping of the environment without giving up in despair\u201d?\nAlternatively, use our lesson \u201cWill It Happen Again? Examining Mass Extinctions on Earth\u201d to explore the perspective some scientists hold that humans are responsible for a major extinction on Earth.\nWhat actions can you take to provide shelter for wildlife in your community? As a class or as a school community, consider following the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s guidelines for building a Schoolyard Habitat. Students might encourage their families to use native plants in their own gardens at home.\nOr, taking a page from City Room\u2019s Hawk Cam project, they monitor a local family of birds or other species and blog about their observations and provide tips for how local people can help animal and plant life thrive.\nStudents assess risks in their regions like rising sea levels and flooding as well as extreme weather and how public opinion about the connections between climate change and these risks help shape politics.\nStudents can also use the Times Topics pages on global warming and climate change to brush up on the latest news and provide their classmates with regular updates.\nYou might also take a look at Andrew C. Revkin\u2019s Dot Earth blog posts \u201cWhat\u2019s A Science Teacher to Do?\u201d and \u201cClimate in Classrooms\u201d or the editorial \u201cPseudoscience and Tennessee\u2019s Classrooms.\u201d Why is climate change \u2013 and the teaching of it in school \u2013 hotly debated? Where do you stand? What is your school or district\u2019s policy?\nUse our lesson \u201cHow Green Is My School? Conducting an Energy Audit\u201d to determine the school\u2019s use of energy.\nNext, students read up on green building projects like the energy- and carbon-neutral headquarters of Seattle\u2019s Bullitt Foundation, which is headed up by Denis Hayes, coordinator of the first Earth Day observation, and net-zero energy buildings. They identify some commercial buildings that meet this standard or have achieved other aspects of high performance buildings. They then brainstorm and propose ways to make their homes or schools achieve a net-zero energy balance.\nStudents explore the concept of geoengineering, or developing technological solutions to climate change caused by human activity. Are geoengineering approaches more feasible than those meant to limit the emission of greenhouse gases? Should we pursue some of these methods, like deflecting sunlight away from earth? What are some potential pitfalls to geoengineering? How might simpler solutions, like installing cool roofs, help mitigate atmospheric warming? How environmentally friendly are so-called \u201cgreen\u201d products? Hold a classroom debate.\nHow is the environment represented in entertainment and culture? What messages do these aspects of popular culture send? What celebrities are associated with environmentalism, and what impact does their activism have? Students choose a specific film, television show, magazine feature or other aspect of culture that features nature or the environment to assess and analyze for its messages and effectiveness at fostering awareness.\nBecause my family moves around alot it made me think of all the Earth Day celebrations that my schools have done, sometimes we did a green up day and others we had a picnic outside in a local deer park. My mom told me a little about Earth day when she was younger. It was really interesting to learn.\nHowever a long ago it was\u2026 I vividly remember each student getting a packet of lima bean seeds. It was our MISSION to successfully grow the plant throughout the rest of the year. This was when I visually learned about how plants literally learn towards sunlight."}

{"prompt": "How do I know when I should exit a trade?\nAre there some rules on this that I can follow?\nMany traders approach their strategy with one thing in mind: establishing the qualifications for entry. The \u2018edge\u2019 if you will. From there, the trade should take care of itself, right? Not really. How you manage a trade after it has been taken is perhaps the most important dynamic to a true strategy (as opposed to approaching the market trade by trade). Once in a trade, you have cast your line; and the result will ultimately be a gain or a loss. Yet, unless you think this one trade will make you wealthy enough to retire after its closed; it is important to establish some consistent (if flexible) parameters for when you should exit the market with a profit or (preferably) a tolerable loss. What are the considerations you should account for when looking for the exit?\nThe first rule for plotting your exit is to have some notion of how you will get out of your trade before you even put it on. For those traders that are utter beginners, we usually hammer home the concept of defining a hard stop and target before you even enter a position. This is just", "baseline": "a suggestion to instill good habits \u2013 namely: don\u2019t trade with emotions. That being said, absolutes aren\u2019t conducive to trading. You need to retain some level of flexibility for a market and financial structure that is adaptable. Nonetheless, we still need to establish some ground rules; because a preconceived notion of an exit can bring significant clarity to the success or failure of your trade. It is a good exercise to ask yourself in the middle of a trade whether this is a good position or not and why. Even those supremely confident in their trading skills and can answer the first question will still have to take a cold hard look at their reasoning.\nWhen going about establishing exit points, you should consider a \u2018graceful\u2019 exit whether you have a winning or losing trade. Both scenarios should be accounted for on the initial development of the trade. A stop is pretty straight forward. If the market has broken a specific technical level or the notional loss on the position breaches your tolerance level, it is time to exit and reassess (never right-off a pair altogether, you will have to trade the pair again sometime in the future). Yet, I like to combine technicals and money management when establishing my own stops. I will typically only risk 1 to 5 percent of my total equity on any single trade. That is a hard fast rule. Now, I look at the technical scenario. If a reasonable place to set my stop is too far from the entry or it happens to be very close, I will use that level and simply alter my position size such that my total risk will always fit that 1 to 5 percent rule while maintaining the technical setup.\nTargets are a different story. As it is often said: \u201cyou should cut your losers and let your winners run.\u201d This is advice to live by; but how? Well, we have capped our losses; but balancing your take-profit is more difficult. The first thing to do is refer back to your stop. How much risk did you take on the outlay? Your trade should be able to compensate for that risk and more. But, how do we do this without leaving the trade open to emotions taking control and stopping a trade out too soon or keeping it on for so long that it reverses? What if we set our first target near or equal to the initial risk taken? This target should be set within meaningful technical bounds so that nothing prevents the setup from playing out aside from natural market forces. With this approach, we are trading with multiple objectives. That first target is to simply reduce the risk with the trade. A big emotional weight will be lifted when you book this allotment. To further lift the haze of fear and greed, we can trail the stop on the remaining portion of the position. Now, with the remaining half of the position, you can \u2018let your profits run.\u2019 If you initially entered a trade with the belief that it would force a medium-term breakout; and you just took half profit and curbed your risk. You can now wait for that move to happen with a cool head. For the second half, it is important not to just let it drift. Have a target level or wait for momentum to turn against your position (the end of or pause in a trend).\nThis further leads us to consider: how long should all of this take? Too few people actually consider when they go into a trade that it should take X-number of minutes, hours or days. Typically, they wait until their patience is tested; and that is when their good trading habits start to break down. A simple way to establish how long a trade should take is to first consider what time frame you are looking at your charts or fundamental developments. If you are waiting for global economic activity to accelerate, then you are talking about a broad driver that can take weeks or months. If you are looking at a range and potential breakout candidate on a daily chart that has taken three weeks to develop, allow for at least a couple days. If you have watched a repeatable pattern develop on a five minute chart; your scalp should develop over approximately the same time as the previous pattern. And, what should you do after your time is up? Exit. Don\u2019t think twice. Just exit the trade and reassess when that pair will once again be a good long or short."}

It's literally putting Facebook in your face.\nWhile that may have appeal to heavy-duty Facebook users who want to be in constant touch with their social graph, it raises some issues about \"presence.\" People have their phones with them almost all the time, including when they're interacting with friends, family, and work colleagues, and many of us (myself included) have a habit of paying attention to our phones when, perhaps, we should be paying attention to the people around us.\nFacebook isn't creating any new problems with this software, but it is making it even easier to be distracted.

And though it has yet to be officially recognized in the United States, there are Asian countries that recognize a condition that's being called \"Internet Addiction Disorder.\"\nTo find out more, I spoke with three experts: Dr. Jeff Szymanski, a clinical psychologist and executive director of the International OCD Foundation, Robin Maier, a Tampa-based Licensed Clinical Social Worker, who has blogged about ADD and texting, and Dr. Michael Rich, the director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children's Hospital (scroll down for podcast interview).\nI asked each of them to help me understand where to draw the line between normal, though perhaps sometimes annoying, use of technology and when it becomes a serious problem. All three used the traditional definition of addiction: when it interferes with family life, work, or achieving your goals. Szymanski made the distinction of when constant attention to a phone might be necessary versus when it's not. \"If a sports editor checks scores several times a day, it might make sense,\" he said. But if it's not a job requirement and you do it so often that it \"interferes with your work, your relationships, and your day-to-day functioning,\" it could be an unhealthy compulsive behavior. Maier worries that people \"on the ADD spectrum who find it harder to stay focused\" could easily be distracted by their phones to the point that \"it affects their personal relationships.\"\nDr. Rich asks people to think about whether they're using their device \"more and more all the time in order to get the same level of satisfaction,\" whether they \"start to experience negative symptoms\" when they're away from it, and whether they're willing \"to take on negative consequences such as your wife being angry with you or your colleagues being annoyed with you in order to maintain that habit.\"\nDisclosure: Larry Magid is co-director of ConnectSafely.org, a nonprofit Internet-safety organization that receives financial support from Facebook.\nClick below to listen to podcast interview with Dr. Rich."}

Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein\u201d tweeted @natsecwonk, a popular anonymous tweeter who was revealed by the Daily Beast this week to be senior National Security Council staffer Jofi Joseph. In an ironic turn, Joseph has now suffered the same fate as his once-Twitter target Wiener: losing a high-profile political position due to reckless tweeting.\nWhat sets Joseph apart from the majority of people who lose their jobs by way of social media is that he took pains to anonymize his online activity. Twitter, unlike Facebook and Google+, does not require users to create accounts under their own names. Many Twitter users\u2014including Anthony Weiner\u2014do link their accounts to their real-life identities, but others do not, leading to a wide variety of anonymous novelty accounts and humorous parody accounts for famous people.

It\u2019s also a place where powerful and high-profile figures can take on the voice of anonymous, uninhibited handles.\nBut social media identities are rarely completely anonymous, even when they are not governed by real name policies. Online activity almost always leaves a trail. Part of that trail is technical\u2014companies like Twitter and Facebook log IP addresses and other data associated with user logins, which courts can compel them to turn over in certain cases\u2014but it\u2019s not clear that the Joseph investigation relied on any such technical tracing via Twitter\u2019s internal records.\nReading through Joseph\u2019s tweets, it\u2019s not hard to imagine how a careful analysis of whom he discussed and what he talked about might be enough to let investigators deduce his true identity. His tweets read almost like a trail of breadcrumbs, dropping clues about whom the author worked with, what events he attended, what issues he followed. An investigation into Joseph\u2019s travel and shopping patterns might mean trying to geo-locate IP addresses used to access the Twitter account at certain times and then matching that location data to places where Joseph was known to be shopping and traveling. But the fact that these patterns were \u201cparsed\u201d from the corpus of tweets suggests the investigation may instead have involved mining the text of the thousands of tweets posted from the now-deleted account to identify specific stores, restaurants, or destinations that Joseph visited. Or perhaps the timing of the tweet postings was analyzed and compared against Joseph\u2019s known patterns of behavior and daily schedules. Piecing together these types of behavioral data may not be easy\u2014the investigation into @natsecwonk\u2019s identity apparently lasted months\u2014but it\u2019s far from impossible.\nTechnical clues are only part of the identity trail we create on social media sites. The ways in which our behavior and relationships on Facebook and Twitter mirror and intersect with our real-life behavior and relationships can provide equally powerful clues about who we really are. In some cases these social hints may be even more significant than technical traces\u2014after all, an IP address can be spoofed, but an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the White House national security operation is harder to fake.\nJoseph intended to pen one of the entertaining, satirical commentary accounts that Twitter has become famous for\u2014accounts like @justin_buber, @notzuckerberg, @queen_uk, or @PimpBillClinton\u2014but he ended up in the middle of a career-ending debacle instead. Sure, he kept the account running for more than two years, but ultimately he ran into the fundamental problem of trying to remain anonymous in an online social world where\u2014much like in Washington, D.C.\u2014the whole point is to network, to connect with other people, to know and be known."}

{"prompt": "How critical can one be of Israel? It is a question that Germany has been debating since SPIEGEL ONLINE columnist Jakob Augstein was included on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of the world's worst anti-Semites. Political leaders in Berlin have a different answer than Germans at large.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has charted a firmly pro-Israeli course.\nDoes Angela Merkel mistrust the very people she governs? Is she uncomfortable with the German people?\nIn October 2011, the German chancellor stood onstage at the academy of the Jewish Museum, in Berlin, next to conductor Daniel Barenboim. The celebratory concert had concluded, and the museum's director had just presented Merkel with its Award for Understanding and Tolerance.\nThis is one of many awards the chancellor has received from Jewish institutions over the last couple years, including the Heinz Galinski Prize from the Jewish Community of Berlin, the American Jewish Committee's Light Unto the Nations Award and an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University.\nAt the Jewish Museum,", "baseline": "Merkel spoke a few pleasant words, calling the award both an honor and a responsibility. Then she cited a study, according to which 60 percent of Europeans -- including Germans -- consider Israel the most significant threat to world peace.\nFollowing Merkel's logic seems to present a conclusion that two thirds of Germans harbor anti-Semitic sentiments. Is this really what the chancellor believes? Or was her intention simply, as she said in her speech, to warn against allowing anti-Semitism to increase?\nMerkel's speech provides a direct path into the minefield that is relations between Jews and Germans, and between Germany and Israel. Of course it is absurd to label Israel the world's worst aggressor. But does simply making such a statement count as anti-Semitism? Where does objective criticism end and defamation begin? The controversy over journalist Jakob Augstein's columns in SPIEGEL ONLINE and elsewhere has re-ignited this debate, a storm triggered when the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles placed Augstein on its list of the world's worst anti-Semites.\nTwo different arenas of discussion have arisen in Germany in recent years, one for the country's politicians and one for the public. Most politicians cling tightly and fearfully to the safety of the official line when they give speeches. Particularly members of the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, haven't forgotten the 1988 case of Philipp Jenninger. Then president of the Bundestag, Jenninger expressed himself unclearly in a commemorative speech on the anniversary of the Nazi Kristallnacht pogroms in 1938, leaving his own views too open to interpretation. Within 24 hours of that speech, Jenninger resigned.\nThe general public, on the other hand, is tired of the strictures that dictate what can and cannot be said for the sake of maintaining good German-Israeli relations.\nEvery society needs its taboos, of course. In Germany, Holocaust denial is one such taboo, as is casting aspersions on Israel's right to exist. But doesn't each era need to find its own particular language in which to communicate? World War II has been over for more than six decades. The generation that perpetrated the crimes is dying out. Germany has become one of Israel's closest allies, as can be seen from the billions of euros' worth of arms sales from Germany to Israel. Isn't that grounds enough for speaking openly, even expressing severe criticism if necessary?\nThe chancellor certainly doesn't think so. More than any other head of government, she has aligned Germany with Israel. Some see these efforts toward reconciliation with the Jewish people as the only conviction the chancellor truly holds. \"She takes the matter personally,\" says Deidre Berger, head of the Berlin office of the American Jewish Committee. Shimon Stein, former Israeli ambassador to Germany, was even a private guest at Merkel's weekend house in the Uckermark region northeast of Berlin.\nIn a 2008 address to the Knesset, Merkel declared Israel's security \"part of my country's raison d'\u00eatre.\" Even more spectacular was the statement that followed: \"And if that is so, then these cannot be allowed to remain empty words at a critical time.\" This can only be understood as Merkel assuring Israel that Germany will step in with military aid if necessary.\n\"A German politician must establish a relationship of mutual trust with Israel, so that criticism of Jerusalem is not misunderstood,\" says Ruprecht Polenz, a member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and chair of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Bundestag. Chancellor Merkel has certainly done this. But she has also offered at most quiet protest over Israel's settlement policy, to little effect. Many within the Chancellery are frustrated that these arguments have not moved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the least.\nMerkel's unconditional solidarity with Israel has thus failed to pay off, yet at the same time her approach has distanced the chancellor from many Germans, who are unwilling to follow her so unconditionally. Just how wide that rift has grown could be seen in the public debate last spring over a poem by G\u00fcnter Grass, in which the author portrayed Israel as the aggressor in the Middle East and a threat to world peace. None of the country's top politicians came to Grass' defense. Hermann Gr\u00f6he, secretary general of the CDU, said he was \"appalled\" by the poem and even Sigmar Gabriel, chair of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) stated, \"Some of it is excessive, and in many parts hysterical.\" These reactions only made the public's support for Grass all the more vehement, with letters piling up in the parties' headquarters expressing outrage over the politicians' rebuke of Grass.\nWhat exactly does this response signify? Are the Germans a nation of anti-Semites, with the ugly countenance of hatred toward Jews lurking behind every corner, as author Tuvia Tenenbom recently suggested in his book \"I Sleep in Hitler's Room: An American Jew Visits Germany\"?\nThere have been a number of studies on anti-Semitism in Germany, and few topics have been examined as extensively as Germans' sentiments toward Jews. The most recent major study, conducted on behalf of the Federal Interior Ministry, clocks in at 204 pages.\nStill, the question remains: How can one measure an attitude, a feeling? In what units is hate calculated? Is someone an anti-Semite if they say Jews have too much influence in Germany? Or if they express agreement with the opinion that Jews never look after anyone but themselves and their own?\nOne thing can be said for certain, and that is that Germany falls more to the middle of the spectrum on such questions. In Poland and Hungary, for example, anti-Jewish sentiment is far more widespread than in Germany. All told, according to the Interior Ministry study, 20 percent of Germans harbor latent anti-Semitism.\nCertainly these numbers should be taken with a degree of skepticism. The researchers themselves admit it's impossible to produce clearly measured results in this field. But one thing is clear: Germans' anti-Semitism acts as a great temptation in politics -- any politician looking to garner votes for his or her party quickly can play on anti-Jewish sentiment.\nThat, though, is a dangerous game, as politician Martin Hohmann found out when he used the term \"a nation of perpetrators\" in connection with Jews. Merkel excluded him from the CDU's parliamentary group as a result.\nThe story of J\u00fcrgen W. M\u00f6llemann ended badly as well. M\u00f6llemann, a top politician in the Free Democratic Party (FDP), played a game that held not only many voters in thrall, but his own party as well, stating in an interview that he could sympathize with Palestinian suicide attackers, and accusing then-Vice President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany Michel Friedman of being \"intolerant and spiteful.\"\nFDP party head Guido Westerwelle was slow to take any action on M\u00f6llemann. Not until Hans-Dietrich Genscher and the party's higher-ups intervened did Westerwelle break with M\u00f6llemann. Israel hasn't forgotten the incident and keeps Westerwelle, now Germany's foreign minister, under close observation to this day because of the M\u00f6llemann affair.\nIsrael feels under threat more than ever before, both from Iran and through the developments throughout the Arab world, and that sensitivity is only growing. At the same time, from Germany's perspective there are many reasons to view Israeli policies critically. The country has changed, with demographic changes due to immigration from Eastern Europe and Africa causing a political shift to the right. Hardliners will have the say here for the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, Israel's settlement policy will soon render the idea of a Palestinian state impossible. When Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD's top politician on foreign policy issues, recently attended a political congress in Israel, he met hardly any politicians still working for a two-state solution -- the solution Germany considers the only viable path to peace in the Middle East. \"It was sobering,\" Klose stated.\nWhat, then, should Germany do? Klose says he still believes the German government should refrain from publicly reprimanding Israel. \"Why should Germany of all countries make itself Israel's critic?\" he asks.\nBut some younger politicians take a different view, and are increasingly unwilling to stick to the old approach. \"Germany has a historical responsibility,\" agrees Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, 40, head of the CDU in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \"But that's not a blank check to be uncritical in foreign policy.\"\nGermany needs to find a way to be less inhibited in its dealings with Israel, Kl\u00f6ckner suggests. She adds, \"Those who throw around accusations of anti-Semitism at every turn lose credibility.\"\n\"Less inhibited in dealings with Israel\"? \"Throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism\"? Are these acceptable things to say? Kl\u00f6ckner may find herself taking considerable heat for her statements -- or meeting with considerable approval.\nIsrael doesn't care whether Germany endorses the policy of building settlements in what would become Palestine or not. If it doesn't care what the USA thinks, then sadly it certainly won't care what Germany thinks. Germany's role, for many years to come, will be to support Israel when it can, and to keep quiet when it can't. This may not be fair, or rational, but it is a consequence of history, and it is the only honourable course of action that remains for Germany at this time. It is to the great credit of Germany that most its people recognize this reality and are prepared to abide by it. Despite all of the sophistication of international relations, relationships between countries are not so different from relationships between individuals. Wrongs must be righted, and the duration of righting far outlasts the duration of the wronging, and most Germans, even young Germans, know this and accept this, and it honourable and commendable that they do so.\nI could not agree more with clockwatchr. Germany's role, for many years to come, will be (or at least should be) to support Israel when it can.....and to remain quiet when it cannot. As this poster stated, it is a consequence of history! I am a supporter of Germany and its people. But, c'mon, if there is ever to be any criticism of the policies of the Israel govt, it should be left up to other European governments. Some people may think 6 decades (since the Holocaust) is a long time. But in the course of history, it really is not! Yes, indeed, there have been many other atrocities throughout history. But what happened in WWII can NEVER be forgotten. And it is beyond despicable. Sadly, history shows us that it is a consequence of what can happen when a society does not make themselves aware of what is going on around them."}

{"prompt": "Who is Sherlock Holmes? Such is the question posed this summer by Jeffrey Hatcher\u2019s play Holmes and Watson, the final production of the Alley Theatre\u2019s 17-18 season, but it\u2019s also the mystery unraveled within the International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.\nFans have been obsessed with the enigmatic detective since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first set him deerstalking into the world\u2019s collective imagination 130 years ago. In film and television, he and his many contemporary incarnations are more popular than ever. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Houston is getting a cool summer of Sherlock.\nBut who is Sherlock Holmes and why do we in Houston continue to love him so? This was the mystery I set out to solve with a day devoted to murder, mayhem, and the master detective, ever ready to put the world to right.\nFirst up, I headed over the Museum District to discover the very dramatic HMNS exhibition unexpectedly had something of an immersive theater feel. Before entering I received a casebook I would", "baseline": "need to use along my journey into the dark underbelly of Victorian crime fiction.\nThis HMNS exhibition contains manuscripts and artifacts of Doyle\u2019s era which delve into the history of Holmes and give insights into Doyle\u2019s influences, including the writings of Edgar Allen Poe and Doyle\u2019s his real life medical training and studies under Dr. Joseph Bell. The majority of the galleries are organized around a new Holmes mystery, written by noted Doyle biographer Daniel Stashower. The guiding narrative invites visitors to help Holmes solve this latest diabolical case.\nAt times working my way through the exhibition did feel as if I had entered into a role playing theatrical piece. The casebook and displays invited me to attempt some observational exercises, documenting all I saw, solve puzzles and work through a series of problems and experiments. The layout of the galleries gives the impression that Holmes himself was always just a few steps in front of me, in the next room.\nOne of the most fun parts of the experience was watching kids, ages 5 to 65, diligently and sometimes gleefully filling out their casebooks and working through the steps to solve the mystery. Along the way, the exhibition rather sneakily teaches some Victorian history and forensic science all in the guise of putting us through an audition to become Baker Street Irregulars.\nFor fans of the latest onscreen versions of the detective, the exhibition presents several displays of props and costumes from the three most popular current incarnations of the mythology: Guy Ritchie\u2019s steampunk Holmes films starring Robert Downey Jr., the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch Sherlock and CBS\u2019s Elementary.\nOnce I felt my observation skills finely honed, I headed over to the Alley to see if I could out deduce Hatcher\u2019s Sherlock, only to find that in the play, it is the good doctor who must play detective.\nHolmes and Watson, directed by Mark Shanahan, begins three years after the notorious Reichenbach Falls case, when Holmes and his archenemy Moriarty fell to their deaths. Or did they?\nDr. Watson (Jeremy Webb) is invited to a mysterious island asylum by a seemingly concerned, but perplexed Dr. Evans (Bruce Warren). Three inmates (Jay Sullivan, Dan Domingues, and Chris Hutchison) housed there all claim to be Sherlock Holmes. They all have a different story to tell about what happened that fateful night on the Falls and very different motives for telling their tales to Holmes\u2019s best friend, confidant, and biographer. In turn, Watson must discover who is the real Sherlock Holmes, as danger lurks in every night shadow.\nOf course, one of the allures of a good mystery, especially a Holmes play, is seeing if we can keep up with the game and figure out who done it, or in this case who is who, before a Sherlock or Watson explains it all.\nIn only 90 minutes, Hatcher, director Shanahan, and the cast create enough quick plot turns that audiences members might find themselves dizzy at the final reveals. Near the end, I did want to give my (imaginary) Baker Street Irregular badge a congratulatory polish because I did spot a few, though not all, of those plot twists leading up to the finale.\nWhether I half-solved the case thanks to the training the International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes gave me earlier in the day, or it was the years of watching and reading so many versions of the great detective that made me a successful plot sleuth, who, but Holmes, can know.\nHolmes and Watson runs at the Alley Theatre through July 22. The HMNS presents the ticketed International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes through September 30."}

Arenas and Crittenton got into an argument over a card game. Crittenton suggested a fistfight. But Arenas said he was too old to fight and instead said he would burn Crittenton's vehicle or shoot him in the face. Crittenton then told Arenas he would \"shoot the [expletive]\" out of Arenas and shoot Arenas in his surgically repaired left knee. Arenas later told Wizards employees that he was joking about the threats.\nOn Dec. 21, at about 9:30 a.m., Arenas arrived at Verizon Center for practice.

Arenas wrote \"PICK 1\" on a piece of paper and placed it on Crittenton's chair near the guns. Arenas said he also was joking about that.\nWhen Crittenton saw the guns, he said, \"What is this?\"\nArenas told Crittenton, \"You said you were going to shoot me, so pick one.\" Crittenton said he did not need Arenas's guns because he had his own. Crittenton picked up one of the guns from the chair and threw it across the locker room. Crittenton then displayed his own silver-colored, semiautomatic handgun, the prosecutor said.\nAfter the incident, Arenas collected the guns, placed them inside his locker and then put them in a suitcase. He gave the suitcase to another Wizards teammate and told him to take it take it to Arenas's car in the garage. Prosecutors said there was no evidence that the teammate knew what was inside the suitcase.\nWhen the unnamed teammate went to the garage, he did not know which vehicle belonged to Arenas. So the player left the suitcase in the garage. Minutes later, Wizards management learned about the incident and met with Arenas. He admitted he brought the guns from his home in Virginia into Washington. He also told management that Crittenton had a gun.\nWizards management then told security guards to grab the suitcase and remove it from Verizon Center. Arenas led a member of the security staff to the garage and pointed out the suitcase. The security officer then took the guns back to Virginia.\nOn Dec. 24, attorneys for the Wizards and Arenas told the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District about the incident. Authorities then seized the four guns from Arenas's house in Virginia, including the .500 magnum; a .50-caliber gold-plated semiautomatic Desert Eagle with a magazine; a .45-caliber, black semiautomatic Kimber Eclipse with a magazine; and a 9mm Browning with a magazine.\nNow, Arenas must wait until March to learn his fate. Prosecutors and Arenas's lawyer will both issue sentencing recommendations to Morin. Morin will consider those requests along with a mandatory report from the court services division, which will interview Arenas and others. Arenas also must turn himself in to D.C. police by Jan. 29 to be fingerprinted and officially booked.\nHis attorney, Kenneth L. Wainstein, issued a statement saying Arenas \"accepted full responsibility for his actions.\" NBA Players Association chief Billy Hunter said in a statement that the union is \"committed to aggressively representing him.\"\nArenas could have been charged with four counts of illegal gun possession -- one for each of the pistols in the locker room. But as part of the plea agreement, he faces one charge, making it more likely that he'll avoid much jail time, the sources said. As part of the deal, prosecutors agreed not to bring any more charges."}

The story is told a million times in a person\u2019s childhood until they learn the catastrophic truth that Santa is fictional.\nEven celebrities like Mila Kunis and Gina Rodriguez fall for the ploy. But, like most of us, they\u2019ve lived through the deception to tell the tale.

It fooled her for a while, until one year she saw \"Santa\" wearing the same slippers her dad owned.

After seeing their daughter getting bullied for believing in the holiday legend, Carson's parents broke the news that wasn't was fictional\u2014something she didn't take very well.\n\"I think I was about 8 or 9. I was actually devastated. I just loved Santa Claus.

{"prompt": "\"Don't be a \"d--- sheep,\" my father told me this so early and often in my life that I thought the word \"sheep\" started with a \"d.\" But I didn't miss the counsel that I should think for myself and not blindly follow what others, especially my peers, were doing. So I grew up without much appreciation for what it meant to be a follower \u2013 or for the value of good leaders.\nWhen I started to study Christian Science and to probe the Bible more deeply, I gained an understanding of God as a shepherd who would care for and guide His sheep. One day I came across the definition of sheep in Mary Baker Eddy's book, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\": \"Innocence; inoffensiveness; those who follow their leader\" (p. 594).\nThis gave me a new insight into the role of sheep. Being a follower didn't seem so bad if it involved the qualities of innocence and inoffensiveness. I saw that my dad's counsel was against blindly following the wrong leader, as Jesus warned: \"If the blind lead the blind", "baseline": ", both shall fall into the ditch.\"\nBlindness, which can mean holding so firmly to our own opinions that we can't see others' perspectives, is not good in either a follower or a leader. And since we all have opportunities to be both followers and leaders, we need to know how and when to do both.\nDoris Kearns Goodwin has written much about leaders and leadership. In her latest book, \"Team of Rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln,\" she sets out much of what makes a good leader.\nIn an interview Ms. Goodwin was asked, \"What personal qualities made Lincoln such a successful leader?\" She answered in part, \"Lincoln had a quiet self-confidence that allowed him to surround himself by people better known than he was.... Lincoln also had the ability to absorb and listen well to what people were feeling and thinking. He could see both sides of the issue\" (July 6, www.forbes.com).\nWhen a situation cries out for good leadership, it also demands followers. It's obvious that humility is required to be a follower, but it takes even more humility to be an effective leader. Certainly it means dropping selfish ambition for the rewards of leadership and adopting the ambition to serve.\nThroughout the Hebrew Bible, great leaders such as Moses and the prophets frequently referred to themselves as servants of the Lord. This positive sense of servitude was instilled in Jesus from his early Jewish training, and he said plainly, \"Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant\" (Matt. 20:27).\nLeadership involves being servant both to God and to our fellow human beings. In essence, the leadership role is far from being exalted above others. Mary Baker Eddy, the Leader of Christian Science, wrote, \"The true leader of a true cause is the unacknowledged servant of mankind (\"Miscellaneous Writings 1883-1896,\" p. 266). Thinking of oneself as a servant instead of a master is essential to having faithful followers. When this attitude of serving is exhibited in a leader, his or her right to authority is upheld by divine law.\nThe ultimate goal for both leaders and followers, I believe, is to see God's kingdom come on earth and for us to find our direction to do God's will. While the journey may seem difficult, we can retain our inspiration by looking to the example of Jesus, the greatest leader of all time.\nIt is unfeigned love for both God and our fellow humans that makes a good leader, caring for the flock he or she is to guide. And the \"sheep\" find comfort as they follow their leader. Their innocence and freedom from taking or giving offense will save them from the wrong leadership, even as it saves the leaders from mistakes and failures. In scriptural terms, we are all taught (led) by God.\nRobert Reich What makes a leader?"}
{"prompt": "Why is Christmas pagan and what is an alternative tradition to Christmas one can do instead? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\nWhy is Christmas pagan and what is an alternative tradition to Christmas one can do instead?\nPaganism is merely a religion other than one of the main world religions. In other words, the only thing that distinguishes paganism from Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Shintoism, or Judaism is the number of people that have signed up for the newsletter. It isn\u2019t something to fear and it is bigotry to act like it is.\nChristmas is a holiday that has evolved due the passage of time and the influence of various cultures as Christmas has entered their lives. Each of those cultures has enriched the holiday, giving us more traditions with which to celebrate it.\nIf we traveled to the ancient world, we would find some kind of celebration at that time, in many places, each at first independent of the others. For the ancient Romans, that holiday was called Saturnalia, named for the", "baseline": "god Saturn. Saturnalia was celebrated by feasts, the giving of gifts, and a brief sense of equality through role-reversal as the masters tended to the servants. The ancient historian, Livy, tells us that Saturnalia began in 497 BC. Modern historians believe it probably started earlier than that. So, at least half a millennia after the origin of Saturnalia, Jesus Christ was born. His birth was not initially a holiday, because birthdays were not then celebrated in Jewish culture. It would be a few centuries until early church leaders decided it was a day to put on the calendar and commemorate. It would also be a few centuries until they decided to pick a day for that celebration, because the gospels do not tell us on what day he was born.\nOn December 25th, 274 AD, the Emperor Aurelian consecrated the temple of Sol Invictus, creating a holiday called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti \u2013 the birthday of the Sun \u2013 officially elevating the Sun to the highest position among the gods \u2013 nudging a steering current towards monotheism.\nShepherds watch their flock by night during lambing season, which is the spring. But there\u2019s no rule that says a day of celebration has to coincide with the actual date of origin. In Britain, we celebrate the Queen\u2019s birthday on June 9th instead of her actual birthday of April 21st, because April showers bring May flowers.\nSo, in Rome in the fourth century, there were three big holidays being celebrated on December 25th \u2013 Saturnalia, Dies Natalis Sol Invictus, and the Dies Natalis of the Christ. It\u2019s only natural that elements from these celebrations would cross-pollinate each other, especially when they fit so well \u2013 for example, the gift giving of Saturnalia could be adopted by Christians as symbolic of their God giving his only son to them as a gift on that day.\nAs Rome faded and Christianity grew, the people that celebrated those holidays would take their traditions to new areas. As those early Christians moved into Northern Europe and introduced Christmas to the native Germanic peoples, the practices of Christmas were influenced by the practices of those peoples for their winter solstice holidays. Over time, traditions like the Yule log, mistletoe, tree decorating, and evergreen wreaths were absorbed and became thought of as Christmas traditions. The Saxons, the Vikings, the Victorians, and the capitalists have all added traditions to the rich tapestry of the holiday we all call Christmas.\nThere\u2019s nothing to be feared from those traditions. They are additive, not dilutive. Pagan contributions are not something to fear. Heck, today is Wednesday, for English speakers and Miercoles for Spanish speakers. Where do you think those names come from? Wednesday comes from the pagan Germanic god Woden and Miercoles comes from the pagan god Mercury. We are no more corrupted by having a \u201cpagan\u201d Christmas tree in our house than we are by having a calendar that says Wednesday or Miercoles on it.\nChristmas: How did your kid react when you told them Santa isn't real?\nHolidays: What is the best wine to go with turkey?\nHistory: What is the coolest obscure historical fact you know?"}
{"prompt": "While specific incidents involving police violence \u2013 from the killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO, to the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island \u2013 have been highlighted in protests all over the country since the summer, some commentators have attempted to contextualize the unrest. They detail what many describe as the daily injustices, especially in black communities, suffered by residents in their routine interactions with the police.\nIt is these daily interactions that create the foundational distrust that has exploded into a national phenomenon this year, activist Opal Tometi explained.\nYet, the police do not act independently but within a wider framework attentive to social order and, in many places, the maintenance of the status quo.\nIn New York City, local policing reforms have focused on departmental policies and tactics, but less attention has been paid to the bedrock of the NYPD's authority, the laws that officers, as agents of the state, have been empowered to enforce.\nIn New York City alone, there are nearly 10,000 laws, violations, rules, and codes that a person might break, and the NYPD initi", "baseline": "ates approximately 1 million punitive interactions with residents every year. Almost none of these interactions have anything to do with serious crime. About half result in summonses. Of arrests, just 25 percent are related to felonies. Between 2001 and 2013 there were nearly 7 million summonses issued in New York City, compared to 5 million 'stop-and-frisks' during the same period. In 2014, tickets for jaywalking were up about 275 percent.\nIt hasn't always been this way. A concerted effort was made by city lawmakers in the 1990s to expand the authority of the NYPD to include enforcement for behaviors that had not previously been considered crimes. This shift provided legal justification for the routine intrusions that some, like Tometi, have pointed to as provocation for the apparent decline in legitimacy felt towards the police in specific neighborhoods around the New York City.\nWhile the police have borne the brunt of recent protests targeting criminalization and brutality, lawmakers have generally been left off the hook, despite their crucial role in determining which behaviors are considered \"criminal\" and which are not. The City Council - not the police - has the power to roll back some of these laws, providing them with perhaps the largest lever to push in fundamentally changing the relationship between the police and residents. The Council also provides oversight for the NYPD and controls, with the Mayor, the agency's budget.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, law enforcement resources were focused on serious crimes. As order-maintenance policing became en vogue in academic circles, and was adopted by NYPD Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani here in New York, the size of the police force was expanded and the emphasis shifted from policing serious crimes to the enforcement of low-level penal code violations and infractions of the City's administrative codes. Above all, Bratton wanted an increase in the number of interactions between the police and the public.\nFor the police to stop people constitutionally, however, they needed justification. In addition to beefing up enforcement on existing low-level laws, a strategic effort was made by the City Council and Giuliani, at the NYPD's urging, to create new laws explicitly for this purpose. Thus \"aggressive panhandling\" entered the realm of criminal conduct. At the time some council members balked, claiming the new laws and codes were \"repressive,\" that the NYPD should not have increased authority to control particular behaviors, but today, it's the new normal.\nIn the early 1990s, along with a huge rise in misdemeanor arrests (recently detailed in a John Jay College report) there was a concomitant rise in summonses, which refer to behaviors, typically, that do not rise to the level of criminality. The number of summonses issued by the NYPD exploded, jumping from 150,000 in 1993, to nearly 500,000 just five years later. Of the seven most common summons infractions, which make up about half of all summonses in New York City, only two are actually penal code violations - that is those laws dictated by the State of New York. The others are violations of administrative code, health code, parks rules, and traffic law - generally local rules dictated by City Council. Open liquor container citations - an administrative code violation - were, in 2013, the top summons offense in the city. At least one judge has suggested that the police are enforcing this rule in a racially discriminatory way.\nIn the beginning, state lawmakers pushed back against this effort by the City Council, Bratton, and Giuliani to criminalize what had previously been legal behavior (in some cases de facto), in large part because they were concerned about the costs associated with adjudicating these new criminal cases \u2013 almost all of them violations and misdemeanors \u2013 in court. And so, in 1995 the State enacted a law that removed from criminal court jurisdiction all non-misdemeanor offenses charged under the Administrative Code. This would have made infractions, such as open container and public urination, into civil penalties, akin to a traffic ticket to be adjudicated in administrative, rather than criminal proceedings. Giuliani viewed the state law as \"potentially devastating\" because it divested the City of certain law enforcement authority.\nAt the behest of Giuliani, the City Council responded to the state bill with its own legislation to retain jurisdiction over violations. This allowed the police to continue the practice of using infractions as justifications to stop, question, detain, search, warrant check, and identify people who were suspected of breaking minor rules. This cemented the heyday of so-called \"broken windows policing\" - which Bratton, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and others credit for leading to the city's precipitous drop in violent crimes, although this assertion is contested.\nIn one manifestation of the approach, marijuana enforcement was increased as a way to control public gatherings of youth \u2013 not necessarily to curb marijuana use. \"The police were not really interested in the possession of marijuana but instead used marijuana arrests to try to discover people with felony warrants outstanding against them,\" Criminologist Frank Zimring explained.\nOne result of Bratton's new strategy was a dramatic increase in the number of defendants in criminal court with no prior criminal court experience \u2013 and the population of people marked with a criminal record began to grow swiftly. As did distrust of police. People with criminal records or open and unresolved cases are left vulnerable to heightened enforcement should they come into contact with police at a later date.\nOver forty certified city agencies \u2013 from the Human Resources Administration to the Sanitation Department \u2013 have the legal authority to issue summonses, yet the vast, vast majority are written by the NYPD. In 2013 there were 458,095 summons issued citywide, down from 510,270 the year before and from a peak of 648,638 in 2005. As of late 2014 the city was on pace to see the decline continue, a trend perhaps welcomed by the communities most heavily impacted by summons practices \u2013 the same communities targeted by stop-and-frisk, vertical patrols, and Operation Impact.\nAs the data shows, it is specific neighborhoods targeted for this type of policing. For example, there were roughly the same number of summonses issued in the single Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook as issued in the entire borough of Staten Island in 2012; the jurisdiction of the Red Hook court covers approximately 200,000 people - less than half the population of Staten Island.\nAlso targeted are specific demographic groups. While only 17 percent of dogs in the city are licensed, according to an estimate by the Health Department, 91 percent of people ticketed for the offense of having an unlicensed dog are either Black or Latino. Black residents are especially likely to be stopped by police when they are moving through a mostly white neighborhood, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union. Police argue they simply go where the crime is.\nBroken Windows policing in New York City has been operationalized to mean the aggressive enforcement of minor crimes and violations in specific, targeted neighborhoods, and, as the NYCLU analysis suggests, against specific demographics of people; whether or not any of this has had any impact on crime reduction in New York remains unproven.\nThere is no empirical evidence to support the idea that aggressively enforcing so-called \"quality of life offenses\" through police actions has had a positive impact on public safety. These behavioral offenses, some of which are technically crimes, and others, like riding a bike on the sidewalk, which are violations, have come to include actually legal actions such as playing music on the subway platform or falling asleep on the train, for which people are now receiving criminal summonses.\nSome academics have argued that the social costs of these enforcements, which might lead to job loss, housing eviction, or loss of parental rights, outweigh the benefits.\nMeanwhile arresting and incarcerating, for example, a homeless person who cannot afford bail, costs the city at least $600 per day simply for housing at Rikers Island, which does not include the law enforcement or court administration costs; financially there is not a more expensive option to manage this quality of life concern.\nBratton and de Blasio have been vocal supporters of this type of policing, generally, while acknowledging the necessity of reforming the manner in which police interact with the public and suggesting that there should be off-ramps for people who have already been arrested to avoid spending time in jail for minor crimes. Arrests in 2014, both the gross numbers and the volume of misdemeanor cases, virtually mirror those of 2013 - the final year of the previous administration.\nThese policies have already scarred a generation of New Yorkers with criminal records and seem to have played a starring role in inspiring the profound distrust of the police felt in certain communities in New York. This distrust has turned to widespread civil unrest in the wake of the death of Eric Garner, who was accosted by six police officers soon after breaking up a fight. It doesn't seem from the evidence we have that Garner, accused of selling \"loosies\" \u2013 a tax violation \u2013 was breaking any laws when he was stopped by the police that day. He did not have any illegal cigarettes on him at the time of his death and was never charged with a crime.\nYet, the broken windows policies implemented by the City Council empowered the police to attempt to take him into custody. The law Garner was accused of violating, roughly speaking, is a similar type of offense as being paid off the books to babysit.\nIn December, New York City Council members joined the protests against police brutality, staging a \"die-in\" on the steps of City Hall, chanting \"I Can't Breathe\" and \"I am Eric Garner\" to honor the Staten Island man. Even as the City Council decried the results of the overreach of police influence, the body, led by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, has sought to add 1,000 new cops to the force. While these additions would ostensibly be given the additional training and oversight aimed at improving the quality of police-resident interactions, (new training chief Michael Julian is working with officers to get them to swear less frequently) the Council could also consider using its legislative authority to reduce the quantity of police-resident interactions.\nWhile a small number of members have raised concerns about broken windows policing specifically, the Council as a whole has remained mostly silent on the unlimited role of the police in initiating the interactions with residents of the City that invariably lead to summonses, arrests, and incidents of brutality. The Council did announce a plan to open CCRB outposts in the district offices of participating council members, but it is unclear how many members will participate and when, or if, that initiative will get off the ground.\nThe police reform legislation currently before the Council, such as the Right to Know Act, which has wide support among council members but is opposed by Bratton and de Blasio, focuses on the content of police interactions rather than the number.\nThere has yet to be a legislative proposal for the Council to invoke its authority to limit the role of the police by carving out certain quality of life offenses from their jurisdiction or mandating civil enforcement where the NYPD has that discretion. Fare evasion can lead to either a civil summons or an arrest - there were 24,747 such arrests in 2013 and 89,128 summonses. Black residents were most likely to be arrested, rather than given a summons.\nIronically, the NYPD, in apparent protest following the death of two on-duty officers last month has stopped enforcing many quality of life violations. While the sample size remains too small thus far to provide much statistical evidence either for or against a reduced role for law enforcement, it does provide an opportunity for the City to consider ways of addressing community concerns besides the knee-jerk response for more police.\nAccording to former cop and current John Jay professor Eugene O'Donnell, rank-and-file officers would welcome a reduction in their responsibilities to enforce quality of life concerns. \"The root of this is that loose cigarette enforcement is a lunatic mission that no cop ever joined the NYPD to be part of,\" O'Donnell recently said.\nNick Malinowski is a social worker and independent journalist, living and working in Brooklyn; and is on Twitter @nwmalinowski."}

We have all the data we're ever going to have about 'Oumuamua,\" David Trilling, an astronomer at Northern Arizona University who led Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the object, told Business Insider. \"Now it's trying to understand if we can tell a story.

The odds, in fact, were low enough that practically no one was overtly looking for these space objects.\nThen on October 19, 2017, Robert Weryk, a postdoctoral student at the University of Hawaii, discovered 'Oumuamua somewhat by accident.\nWeryk was perusing a batch of data collected by an observatory called Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) that sits atop a mountain in Maui. The observatory scans the entire sky each night, allowing astronomers to compare fresh data to the previous evening's. Anything that's bright enough to detect and moving will thus stand out.\nAs Weryk told The Atlantic in November 2017, he initially thought the object was a typical asteroid. But after a glance at the previous evening's data, he realized it was unusual.\n\"I'd never expected to find something like this,\" he said.\nCalculating the exact path of 'Oumuamua took about a week. The math showed it was an object from beyond - way, way beyond. Its orbit was \"unbound\" or loop-less, and it was making a checkmark-shaped trip through the solar system. It had entered from above the plane of the solar system, dipped close to and below the sun, and was exiting out the top.\nThis realization prompted Weryk, fellow astronomer Karen Meech, and others to launch a global effort to observe 'Oumuamua with as many powerful telescopes as possible before it vanished. More astronomers eventually followed suit, though with some delay.\n\"I was caught off-guard, and I think a lot of astronomers were, too,\" Trilling said. \"It took a while for many of us to think, 'I should go look at it.' The delay was people thinking, 'Naw, it couldn't be from another solar system.'\"\nBecause of this element of surprise, and the fact that world-class observatories are scheduled months or years ahead, it took a week or more for powerful telescopes to start looking at 'Oumuamua. Hubble didn't observe it until November 2018, then again before the object vanished from sight in January 2018.\nNo telescope resolved its shape in any discernible detail, though. One observatory was equipped to do so - the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico - but nature had other plans.\n\"Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory missed the opportunity to determine the actual shape of 'Oumuamua due to Hurricane Maria, really bad timing,\" Abel M\u00e9ndez, an astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, told Business Insider.\nIs it a comet, asteroid, or something else?\nAn artist's depiction of interstellar object 'Oumuamua.\nThe observations that were made suggest 'Oumuamua has a fairly uniform surface, is relatively dark, and has a reddish color (which is not unusual for deep-space objects).\nLacking any detailed photograph of 'Oumuamua, astronomers resorted to studying its brightness as the next-best method to deduce its shape. This is because any side of an object that faces the sun will reflect light; a longer side tends to reflect more light than a shorter side because it has a greater area. Repeating changes in brightness can also betray the rough dimensions and 3D-motion of a space object.\nEarly calculations suggest 'Oumuamua tumbles about once every eight hours and has a cigar-shape, with a large-to-small-dimension size ratio of roughly ten to one. That is abnormal.\n\"The most extreme bodies we know of in the solar system are three-to-one,\" Trilling said.\nAnother peculiarity is that in January 2018, on its way toward interstellar space, 'Oumuamua deviated from its predicted path by about 25,000 miles.\nIf 'Oumuamua were a typical comet, this might explain its change of direction: Comets that drift close to the sun warm up, which causes internal gases to evaporate. The shooting jets of these gases can act like small rocket engines, altering the path an object travels and the way it tumbles.\nIn such cases, the evaporating gases form a tail behind the rock. They can also cause big chunks of a comet to break off. But no tail or break-up of 'Oumuamua was definitively seen.\nThere was also another surprise from the Spitzer Space Telescope: It did not detect a heat signature. The fact that Spitzer was unable to detect that heat suggests 'Oumuamua is somewhat shinier than a normal object, since less warmth being absorbed means more sunlight is getting bounced away.\nTrilling said \"shiny\" is relative, though -'Oumuamua could be as dark as \"dirty slush\" in a gutter, and that would be shinier than expected.\n\"We're not talking about a ball of tin foil flying through space,\" he said.\nHowever, an extraordinary possibility - an unnatural object - did occur to some researchers, a few of whom chose to test the idea against the limited observations.\nComet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko as seen by the Rosetta spacecraft on October 9, 2015.\nAvi Loeb, the chair of Harvard University's astronomy department, took the peculiarities of 'Oumuamua as reason to pursue the remote possibility that 'Oumuamua might be alien in origin.\nIn December 2017, Loeb directed Breakthrough Listen (an effort to listen for alien signals that Loeb helps run) to point radio antennas toward 'Oumuamua. No alien communications were detected.\nIn October 2018, Loeb and a colleague wondered in a study whether the object might have a more extreme pancake-like shape. Based on mathematical analysis, they suggested it could perhaps be as thin as a sail that could be pushed by light (also called a lightsail), which might also explain the 0.1% change in direction found by Hubble.\nMost recently, Loeb and an undergraduate student published a brief study suggesting 'Oumuamua might actually have a 50-to-1 size ratio if it's cigar-shaped, or a 20-to-1 ratio if it's more of a pancake.\nLoeb defends his pursuit of the idea as a valid scientific argument, given the data available. In a blog post at Scientific American, he wrote that humans spotting alien technology \"might resemble an imaginary encounter of ancient cave people with a modern cell phone,\" at first interpreting it as \"shiny rock\" and not a \"communication device.\"\nHowever, Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, told Business Insider that Loeb's latest paper is based on a misunderstanding of brightness data from a study that Hainaut co-authored. Hainaut added that Loeb's conclusions \"collapse\" when the uncertainty of the data is taken into account. Loeb and a co-author disputed this, claiming the uncertainty is not as great as Hainaut said.\nMany researchers interviewed by Business Insider also noted that because the observations of 'Oumuamua were relatively distant, limited, and filled with gaps, there's not nearly enough data to reasonably make extraordinary claims (which, as Carl Sagan once quipped, require extraordinary evidence).\nHainaut thinks the object is most likely a \"slightly weird\" space rock, as does Trilling.\n\"All of the evidence is consistent with a rock,\" Trilling said. \"We've never seen an alien spaceship - we have no idea what that evidence would look like. So I think it's just a rock.\"\nTrilling said he accepts the possibility, however remote, that Loeb and his colleagues' \"extreme\" ideas could eventually be borne out.\n\"I don't have any direct evidence that says it has to be a rock and it cannot an alien spacecraft,\" he said. \"The only way to do that is to go visit it.\"\nBut for now, Trilling explained that it's most logical to side with hundreds of years of astronomical research.\nA Falcon 9 rocket built by SpaceX launching a satellite into space.\nSince 'Oumuamua, astronomers have made adjustments at major observatories to allow for more rapid-turnaround observations of the next rare interstellar object that comes to town.\n\"With this one, we were taken fairly by surprise,\" Hainaut said, adding for the next one: \"We are ready.\"\nThe research community has also reconsidered how often things like 'Oumuamua might visit the solar system. Trilling and others published a study suggesting that current observatories may see an interstellar interloper about once every five years. By the mid-2020s - after new telescopes come online that are designed to look for Earth-threatening asteroids - they might be spotted at a rate of once per year.\nThis, in turn, has led multiple groups of researchers to wonder if a small spacecraft could be readied to chase down another interstellar visitor like 'Oumuamua and study it up-close. Hainaut is part of one of the groups researching that idea.\n\"We had a workshop on this in October, and at the beginning of the workshop we said, 'This is impossible.' But after one week of hard work, we realized it's not impossible anymore, it's just difficult,\" Hainaut said. \"Impossible? That's a problem. Difficult? As a first approximation, that just means expensive.\"\nThere's also a chance that, decades from now, a project called Breakthrough Starshot that Loeb is part of might resolve the question of what 'Oumuamua is and is not.\nStarshot aims to propel tiny spacecraft to another star system with powerful lasers, perhaps at around 20% the speed of light. Such robots could also hypothetically be sent to catch up to 'Oumuamua in deep space.\n\"The Breakthrough Starshot is extremely interesting. The problem is that the laser technology that is required is far from being ready,\" Hainaut said. \"I hope it will be one day.\""}

{"prompt": "Mexico's first supercar: Can it compete with the best?\nWhen you think of famous car-producing nations, Mexico is probably not at the top of your list. But two brothers, Guillermo and Iker Echevarr\u00eda, are on a mission to change that with a two-seater built by their own fledgling manufacturer, Vuhl.\nVuhl's first creation, the 05 is a bare-bones halfway home between the sort of car that only cares about going fast around the track, and one that provides more accessible B-road thrills. Yet the fact its 2.0-liter Ford engine develops 285 bhp in something that has a dry weight of 695 kilograms means it is anything but short on performance.\nThe speed at which the 05 went from an idea to a car you can buy is no less impressive than its design. The 05 first surfaced in concept form back in 2013, unveiled by former British Formula One driver Stirling Moss at the Royal Automobile Club in London. A week later, Formula One driver Esteban G", "baseline": "uti\u00e9rrez was driving it up the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed to show it meant business.\nThree years later, sales of the Vuhl 05 have begun.\nIt was all but inevitable that the brothers, who have a background in industrial design, would be bitten by the motoring bug. Their father, Guillermo Echevarr\u00eda senior, was a racing driver and loved to tinker with cars at home -- a pastime that lasted 30 years, Iker explained. No wonder, then, the 05's design inspiration comes from a motoring heyday of unlimited power outputs and few regulations that gave us the legendary Porsche 917 and McLaren M8F.\n\"The Vuhl 05 design is inspired in Can-Am racers from the '70s,\" Iker said. \"No doors, no roof, no windscreen, and an exposed roll bar. The challenge was to make the essence of this iconic cars work in a contemporary concept without looking like a retro.\"\nThe resulting design is an aggressive mix of clean lines, gentle curves mixed with a hint of Batmobile and the function over form ethos seen by other cars in its space. \"It will age well through time,\" he added confidently. \"We intend the Vuhl 05 and it successors to be renowned for their effective simplicity and aesthetics guided by a purity of function.\"\nThough the spirit is Mexican, the Vuhl is incredibly multicultural. The tub holding everything together is Mexican, but around 50 percent of the components are British. The engine, meanwhile, is American and various body panels come from Canada.\nBut is an international pedigree enough to tempt the more snobbish buyer used to British, German and Italian cars?\n\"We are aware that Mexico doesn\u00b4t have an engineering or racing heritage as strong as other countries like Germany or UK which will always be a barrier,\" Iker said. \"Nevertheless, Mexico is living one of its best moments in motorsport with two Mexican drivers in F1 -- Formula 1 -- and (FIA World Endurance Race is) back to Mexico.\"\nLike many fledgling supercar makers, Vuhl has had its share of critics who said Vuhl was going to be yet another wannabe supercar maker that dies a death before it has even started. Yet three years on, the company has just announced a more potent version of the 05 known as the 05RR.\nWith the 05 and 05RR under its belt, Vuhl has cause for celebration yet success takes time and respect must be earned. But for now Vuhl can exploit a gap between a number of established rivals. \"It's a lot of money for a not-actually-that-exotic car, but it sits in a niche above (British manufacturers) Zenos (and) Caterham and below Radical (and) BAC that nobody else seems to be in, so the market is there for the taking,\" motoring journalist Phil Huff, explained. \"That it's Mexican is irrelevant -- I think few people will even realize that.\"\nWith plans to make around 25 05 cars a year, each one costing from \u00a360,000 ($78,250), Vuhl has a long way to go before Britain, Germany and Italy have anything to worry about, but never has Mexico had such a chance to make an impact in the performance car world."}

{"prompt": "Thanks to ever more sophisticated technology, it is much easier to obtain data - and to analyze it - than was thought possible even a few years ago. As a result, there is an understandable feeling that decision-making in organizations today is more scientific and soundly based than was the case in the days when hunches, gut feel and experience guided much activity. However, leaders must not be seduced into thinking that basing decisions on data necessarily makes them beyond reproach.\nIndeed, in an article in the Fall 2018 issue of Rotman Management, the magazine of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, Megan MacGarvie and Kristina McElheran argue that \"in some instances, data and analytics actually make matters worse.\" This is because, even with impressively large sets of data and the latest, most effective analytical tools, executives can still fall into various traps, particularly if they take shortcuts in reasoning in an effort to overcome information overload.\nIn the article, which was previously published in the HBR Guide to Data Analytics Basics for Managers, MacGarvie, associate professor in the markets, public policy", "baseline": "and law group at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, and McElheran, assistant professor of strategic management at the Rotman School of Management and a digital fellow at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, point out that it is widely acknowledged by academics in a variety of disciplines that people do not carefully process every piece of information in every decision. Instead, they say, we rely on heuristics, or simplified procedures that help us make decisions when faced with uncertainty or where there is insufficient money or time for extensive analysis. The result is we think we are making sound decisions when in fact we are making systematic mistakes. On top of this, even with access to data, human brains are geared to adopting certain biases that distort choices often without us being aware of them.\nMacGarvie and McElheran identify \"three main cognitive traps that regularly bias decision-making, even when informed by the best data\" and offer suggestions for avoiding them.\nThe Confirmation Trap. This is what happens when we pay more attention to findings that align with our existing beliefs and ignore other facts and patterns in the data. Confirmation bias can become much harder to avoid when individuals are under pressure from bosses and colleagues to come up with data that supports a pre-existing view of the world, say MacGarvie and McElheran. Their advice for dealing with the issue? Don't avoid information that does not fit with you or your boss's beliefs. Instead, embrace it by such means as specifying in advance the data and analytical approaches that will be used in the decision-making in order to reduce the temptation to \"cherry-pick\" findings; actively seek out findings that disprove your beliefs; do not automatically dismiss findings that fall below your starting point for statistical or practical significance; assign several independent teams to analyze the data separately and if they do not come to similar conclusions concentrate on the points where they diverge in order to see whether the differences are due to error, inconsistent methods or bias; and treat your findings as if they were predictions and test them.\nThe Overconfidence Trap. Senior decision-makers are especially prone to this, say MacGarvie and McElheran, for the simple reason that they tend to assume that they have been promoted on the basis of past successes that have themselves been based on making decisions. But overconfidence can also reinforce many other pitfalls of data interpretation. \"It can prevent us from questioning our methods, our motivation and the way we communicate our findings to others; and it also makes it easy to under-invest in data analysis in the first place,\" they write. This can be a particularly difficult problem to crack because, while overconfidence can dissuade us from spending enough time or money on acquiring more information or doing extra analysis, just acquiring more information can make matters worse by adding to the sense of confidence. As MacGarvie and McElheran say, moving from data to insights \"requires quality inputs, skill and sound processes.\" They stress the importance of processes, making several procedural tips for escaping this trap. Among them are describing your ideal experiment and then comparing this with your actual data to see where it might be lacking; making being devil's advocate a formal part of the process; keeping track of predictions and systematically comparing them with what actually happens in order to test their accuracy; and making such processes a part of the decision-making routine in order to avoid persistent biases creeping back in.\nThe Over-Fitting Trap. This is what happens when a statistical model describes \"random noise\" rather than the underlying relationship an organization is seeking to capture. As MacGarvie and McElheran put it, \"When your model yields surprising or counterintuitive predictions, you may have made an exciting new discovery - or it may be the result of 'over-fitting.'\" They quote Nate Silver, the statistician who found fame for predicting the winner of all 50 states in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, as describing this concept as \"the most important scientific problem you've never heard of.\" The problem is that over-fit models look like they do a very good job of explaining the nuances of the past but struggle to predict the future. To overcome this bias, they suggest randomly dividing the data into a training set, on which the model will be estimated, and a validation set, which will be used to test the accuracy of the model's predictions; as with the confirmation trap, avoid cherry picking data; look for relationships that measure important effects related to clear and logical hypotheses before looking at nuances; look to see whether it is possible to construct another story using the same data; and beware the common tendency to see patterns in random data."}

{"prompt": "Making the most of natural resources of farms is critical in today\u2019s environment, where rainfalls are becoming ever so scarce.\nWhile in Queensland the use of animal recognition technology is being used to conserve water, on the other side of the country in Western Australia, satellite technology is providing farmers with a suite of tools to accurately estimate the amount of feed in their pastures, how quickly their pastures are growing and the pasture quality.\nJointly developed by the CSIRO and Western Australia\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Department of Land Information, the project, called Pastures from Space, uses satellite data from NASA to monitor the efficient use of feed resources in the livestock industries.\nThe Pastures from Space message is clear: use it or lose it.\nFor maximum efficiency on a farm, farmers need to use the pasture when it is at its best. This was one of the main drivers for the project, which predicts the quantity of green pasture in each paddock for a farm, or Feed on Offer (FOO), as kilos of dry matter per hectare.\nAccording to Gonzalo Mata, who is in charge of farming", "baseline": "systems and web development for the project, the general rule of thumb is that only about 20 to 30 per cent of pasture grown is utilised in many beef and sheep production systems. This is because a lack of information on feed resources leads to conservative management as a means of mitigating risk.\n\u201cFarmers need this information in order to match the animals\u2019 nutrient demands for growth and reproduction with the supply of feed which can be very seasonal. If this is not achieved, production is lower or costs increase through the use of supplements to achieve the balance,\u201d Mata added.\nAccording to Mata, you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure, hence the need for allowing farmers to measure how much pasture there is on their farms. The project also predicts the rate of growth of pasture, or Pasture Growth Rate (PGR), on a weekly basis as kilos of dry matter per hectare per day.\nThe PGR tool uses images from a NASA satellite to create a composite greenness index. The climate data is sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology on a weekly basis and the two data sources are combined in a pasture growth model.\nPastures from Space boasts a 97 percent accuracy and it is possible farmers with a subscription (which costs $900 per year) to have sustainable pasture utilisation of more than 50 percent.\n\u201cWhen the farmers get their system up and running, the level of interaction that they have is only limited by their ability to ask questions of the data. New information is downloaded on a weekly basis using a software package called \u2018Pasture Watch\u2019 and can review the automatically generated graphs showing PGR for individual paddocks or combination of paddocks depending of what decision he is trying to make,\u201d Mata said.\nBy going online, the farmer can also look at maps of PGR for their farm, giving them a better understanding of why some parts of a paddock or of the farm are performing better than others.\nAs of 2007, Pastures from Space had 80 commercial subscribers, and the numbers of people accessing the non-specific satellite measurements on the free Web site is growing.\nMata says the numbers have been growing every year by at least 10 percent, and up to late last year, nearly 10,000 unique IP addresses had visited the Web site."}

Today\u2019s Times quotes him saying that \"any barrier or border on the island of Ireland in my view risks undermining a very hard-won peace process\" and that there is a need to ensure the \"free movement of people and goods and services and", "baseline": "livelihoods\".\nThe first is to ignore Dublin (and just about everybody in Northern Ireland for that matter) and institute a hard border along the 310-mile demarcation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Given it takes in fields, rivers and forests it\u2019s pretty unenforceable without a Trump-style wall. More practically, it would devastate trade and free movement. Metaphorically, it would be a powerful symbol of division and entirely contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. The Police Federation in Northern Ireland has also warned it would make police officers \"sitting ducks for terrorists\". Moreover, the Irish government will never agree to this course. With the EU in their corner, there is effectively zero chance of this happening.\nThe second option is to actually keep Northern Ireland inside the EU: offering it so-called \"special status\". This would avoid the difficulty of enforcing the border and even accord with the wishes of 56 per cent of the Northern Irish electorate who voted to Remain in the EU. Crucially, it would see Northern Ireland able to retain the \u00a3600m a year it currently receives from the EU. This is pushed by Sinn Fein and does have a powerful logic, but it would be a massive embarrassment for the British Government and lead to Scotland (and possibly London?) demanding similar treatment.\nThe third option is that suggested by the Irish government in the Times story today, namely a soft border with customs and passport controls at embarkation points on the island of Ireland, using the Irish Sea as a hard border (or certainly a wet one). This option is in play, if for no other reason than the Irish government is suggesting it. Again, unionists will be unhappy as it requires Britain to treat the island of Ireland as a single entity with border and possibly customs checks at ports and airports. There is a neat administrate logic to it, but it means people travelling from Northern Ireland to \"mainland\" Britain would need to show their passports, which will enrage unionists as it effectively makes them foreigners.\nUnpalatable as that would be for unionists, the fourth option is simply to recognise that Northern Ireland is now utterly anomalous and start a proper conversation about Irish reunification as a means to address the border issue once and for all. This would see both governments acting as persuaders to try and build consent and accelerate trends to reunify the island constitutionally. This would involve twin referendums in both Northern Ireland and the Republic (a measure allowed for in the Good Friday Agreement). Given Philip Hammond is warning that transitional arrangements could last three years, this might occur after Brexit in 2019, perhaps as late as the early 2020s, with interim arrangements in the meantime. Demographic trends pointing to a Catholic-nationalist majority in Northern Ireland would, in all likelihood require a referendum by then anyway. The opportunity here is to make necessity the mother of invention, using Brexit to bring Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional status to a head and deal decisively with the matter once and for all.\nIn short, ministers have no easy options, however time is now a factor and they will soon have to draw the line on, well, drawing the line.\nKevin Meagher is a former special adviser at the Northern Ireland Office and author of \"A United Ireland: Why unification is inevitable and how it will come about\""}

{"prompt": "ROCK CREEK -- From calling in Craig Robinson to host the Hollywood-themed 20th annual gala this Saturday, to implementing a new strategic plan, the Washington County Museum is exploring all avenues in a quest to become a community focal point.\nThe transformation started with a renovation to the building on the Portland Community College Rock Creek campus in 2007. A year later, the board of directors hired interim director Sam Shogren with a mission for the museum to offer a more diverse array of programs and events incorporating art, culture and history.\nThe Washington County Historical Society and Museum then became the Washington County Museum.\nWith the help of Shogren and consultant, Susan Suran, community interviews and surveys were conducted to get an understanding of the people the museum serves.\n\"Really what's driving the transformation is recognition by the board of the transformation in Washington County,\" Shogren said.\nIncreasing minority populations is a reason behind programs like the Latino Mobile Museum \u2013 a traveling exhibit that aims to teach local children about the history of Latinos in the county, he said.\nIn July, the museum officially", "baseline": "partnered with Print Arts Northwest, which was struggling to survive. In what PAN interim director Barbara Mason calls a \"natural\" partnership, the lobby of the museum was converted into an art gallery for monthly exhibits. Now on the third Thursday of each month, the community is invited to sip wine at exhibit openings.\nThe museum hosts Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts two Saturdays a month and holds a Crossroads Lecture on regional and cultural history every third Wednesday.\nShogren said museum visitation has increased since his arrival. In 2008, 1,666 visitors walked through the museum doors and so far, 2,455 people have visited this year.In September, the first free Family Day lured in more than 200 people, who Shogren said came from all throughout the Portland metro area. The monthly Family Day events are being funded in part by a grant from the PGE Foundation.\nMuseum membership has also increased in the past year, in fact, it's doubled, he said. As of Jan. 1, the museum had 118 members. Eight months later, that number jumped to 314 members, Shogren said.\nAnd those members are donating more money than ever before.\nShogren said he's seen a significant portion of members who donated between $30 and $50 last year bump up their gift to the \"supporter\" level to $100 or more.\nLast year, members donated a total of $1,252 to support the annual gala and with just a few days before this year's event kicks off, donations have already reached $4,470, he said.\n\"Despite the economy, our members are making a bigger investment in the museum,\" Shogren said.\nTickets are selling well for Saturday's annual benefit, featuring Oregon State University basketball Coach Craig Robinson acting as master of ceremonies.\nProceeds from of the gala titled \"A Swank Affair: Lights, Camera, Action!\" which is sponsored by Reser's Fine Foods, will help finance the museum's educational programs and events.\nWith tickets priced at $150 a person and $270 a couple, the museum's programs should also be fairing well."}
{"prompt": "March 30, 2007: While the users of suicide bombers may not have noticed, the track record of such tactics shows that it doesn't work. In fact, this particular weapon actually backfires. Consider the facts.\nThe Tamil separatists of Sri Lanka (the LTTE) pioneered the modern use of suicide bombers over twenty years ago. The LTTE was particularly effective at attacking senior politicians and security officials. But each attack just made their opponents angrier. The LTTE is now being defeated, partly by an enraged Sri Lankan population, and partly dissention and demoralization within their own ranks.\nHizbollah was the next to pick up on suicide bombers. While Hizbollah claims to represent the Shia minority in Lebanon, it has brought itself increasing resistance from the majority of Lebanese by acting in support for foreign nations. Actually, Hizbollah has largely abandoned suicide bombing, apparently noting the downside of the tactic.\nPalestinian terrorists adopted the use of suicide bombing against Israel in 2000. The Israelis", "baseline": "eventually developed tactics that defeated this weapon, The Palestinian attacks destroyed the substantial support within Israel for a Palestinian peace deal, and increased support for stronger measures against Palestinian terrorism. The Palestinian terrorists are still at it, although many Palestinians admit that the tactic has failed, and been counterproductive.\nAl Qaeda also adopted suicide bomber tactics, particularly in Iraq. This turned out to be a major error. So many Moslems were killed, particularly women and children, that Arab public opinion turned against al Qaeda. Even Sunni Arabs in Iraq have been fighting al Qaeda, despite the fact that al Qaeda is committing all this mayhem in the name of Sunni Arabs.\nAl Qaeda began using suicide bombers in Pakistan four years ago, and were promptly taken apart by an enraged Pakistani government, with much public support. This, despite many Islamic conservatives in the government. Al Qaeda was largely driven out of most of Pakistan, and confined to the tribal areas along the Afghan border. Here, the Taliban had a lot of influence, and al Qaeda has convinced the Taliban to support a suicide bomber campaign in Afghanistan. In the last six months there have been nearly 80 suicide bombing attacks in Afghanistan, over fifty percent more than in the previous six months. This campaign has been even less successful than previous ones. The Taliban do not have the experienced support personnel (bomb makers and bomber handlers) to make most of the attacks successful by any measure. Meanwhile, most of the victims are Afghan civilians. Naturally, Afghans see these foreigners (Afghans are difficult to recruit as suicide bombers) as murderers who do not have Afghan interests at heart."}
{"prompt": "Many in the media and tech industry see Uber\u2019s decision to sell its Chinese business unit to rival Didi Chuxing as a failure for the U.S. ride-hailing giant. It\u2019s easy to believe that the sale of Uber China\u2019s operations to its closest rival is a face-saving exercise, an inevitable outcome for a U.S. company that tried to beat the odds and succeed in China.\nBut the more you chew over the finer points of the deal, the more it looks like an astute piece of business for both parties.\nDon\u2019t believe that this deal was created in haste. The rumor of a merger had been circulating for a month \u2014 with both sides denying it \u2014 and one source close to negotiations told TechCrunch that the two parties had tried to engineer a deal two previous times without success. So it was third time lucky but, more importantly, ongoing discussions suggest that this is more than Uber saving face \u2014 this is an alliance.\nLikewise, don\u2019t believe that Didi acted out of kindness. Didi showed it can raise capital easily when it closed a coloss", "baseline": "al $7.3 billion funding round that even included money from Apple. It could have let Uber continue to spend billions in China and wither, but it wanted to remove its threat from China and perhaps elsewhere. This was two-way; not merely a tactical Uber exit.\nSo, how does the deal play out?\nFirstly, and most obviously, Uber swaps its capital-intensive business unit in China that its own CEO said was costing it $1 billion per year, for a (potentially) near-20 percent stake in the country\u2019s dominant ride-sharing company, valued at $35 billion. That\u2019s a near-11 fold increase on Didi\u2019s valuation when it was formed by a merger in 2015.\nBut there\u2019s certain to be a lot more growth.\nEarlier this summer, Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, estimated that his company is taking just 1.1 percent of China\u2019s taxi market. China\u2019s new regulations, which will legalize Uber and Didi from November, combined with this merger are sure to mean that Didi\u2019s business grows multiples more \u2014 all with Uber as its largest single shareholder.\nThat stake not only allows Uber to move towards a much-anticipated IPO by removing the China cash burn from its balance sheet, but it is likely to be a very lucrative holding in a business with vast potential to grow. Even if Didi has so far denied reports of IPO plans of its own.\nThere are some who argue that Uber could have saved time and money and simply invested in Didi earlier if it wanted this kind of financial return potential. For one thing, it would have needed to choose between Didi Kuaidi and Didi Dache, which eventually merged. But, more than that, it is foolish to believe that Didi Chuxing would have grown into the company that it is today without rivalry from Uber.\nUber, for example, pioneered peer-to-peer in China when it introduced People\u2019s Uber in late 2014. It hadn\u2019t been done before at scale. Didi was unprepared and late to the party, introducing its take on the service some six months later. The company started out working exclusively with licensed taxis, and this example shows that competition with Uber clearly sharpened its business and helped shape its growth.\nThe real negative here looks to be for Didi\u2019s allies: Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.\nThe four companies formed a coalition, dubbed the \u2018Anti-Uber Alliance\u2019, last year for business synergies such as enabling users to roam between services when they travel, and sharing know-how. Alongside that, Didi made investments in its three allies: putting $100 million in Lyft, and contributing undisclosed minority amounts to Ola\u2019s $500 million round last year, and Grab\u2019s most recent $350 million raise one year ago.\nWhile it often seemed like a PR play, the coalition does give Didi\u2019s cohorts solidarity and support, and likely increased confidence to investors, all of which is important when you are battling a global giant like Uber, which is seemingly capable of raising billions in fresh funding on a whim.\nWell, that alliance looks uncertain at best, or messy at worst, following Uber\u2019s deal with Didi.\nNot only has Didi struck a deal with the sworn enemy and given it a sizable chunk of its business, but it made an undisclosed investment in Uber\u2019s global business which Bloomberg pegged at $1 billion. That\u2019s a drop in the ocean for Uber given the numbers it has raised, but, if the figure is correct, then that investment is multiples larger than the money Didi put into its fellow alliance members.\nNot only that, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will sit on the Didi board, no less, while Didi Chairman Cheng Wei will join the Uber board.\nMany, including yours truly, saw the alliance and those Didi investments as a possible first step to acquisitions to expand Didi overseas as and when it saw fit. But this deal with Uber throws all of that into contention. Who is to say that, in Southeast Asia, for example, Didi will back Grab with any vigor now that it is also aligned with Uber. It could let the market play out and then befriend the company that wins.\nThat\u2019s a hypothetical scenario, of course, but it was unthinkable prior to yesterday.\nGrab was bullish on the news, with CEO Anthony Tan coming out positively before the deal was even confirmed. Tan said in a company-wide memo that we obtained that Uber\u2019s exit was proof a regional rival could defeat Uber.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost once, and we will make them lose again,\u201d he told his staff.\nFighting words indeed, but the conditions that forced Uber\u2019s exit from China simply don\u2019t exist in Southeast Asia which weakens the comparison. The subsidies war is almost certainly multiples more modest than China, and Uber is only just getting round to putting the pedal to the floor in the region.\nWhile Tan publicly rallied his troops, you\u2019d imagine that he was privately disappointed at the way this incident has played out.\nLyft, for one, was more measured with its comment on the Uber-Didi deal.\nOla of India declined multiple requests to comment publicly on the deal.\nIt\u2019ll take some time before the smoke clears and we understand more about how this deal impacts the global ride-sharing economy, but right now it looks like Uber is sitting a lot prettier than many people believe."}

{"prompt": "Jerry Cao is a UX content strategist at the wireframing and prototyping app UXPin. For advice on how to conduct 30+ different types of usability tests, check out The Guide to Usability Testing.\nNatural and near-natural tests minimize the amount of interference from the observer, who is more interested in what the user does of their own will. These tests are great for broad data, especially ethnographic, but sacrifice control in exchange for greater data validity.\nBecause the goal is to minimize interference from the study, natural tests are usually conducted remotely and without a moderator. The most common natural tests (A/B testing and field/diary studies) and near-natural tests (first-click tests and eye-tracking tests)\u2014 are intended to understand user behavior and attitudes as close as possible to reality.\nIn an A/B test, different groups of participants are presented with two choices or variations of an element. As explained in The Guide to Usability Testing, these are generally scientific tests, where only one variable differs, while the rest are controlled. Mostly conducted with websites to test if a certain layout,", "baseline": "placement, or messaging will result in better conversions, A/B testing is considered a natural test because users are not notified nor provided a set of tasks.\nCall to actions \u2014 This piece by Hubspot explains how Friendbuy more than doubled their response rate to their CTAs using A/B tests.\nHeadlines \u2014 In this A/B test, it was discovered that a single line of text for headlines increased signups by 38 percent compared to longer ones.\nForms \u2014 A unique style of form field input, the \u201cMad Libs\u201d style, has been proven to increase conversions by 25-40 percent.\nPricing and promotional offers \u2014 Another A/B case study shows explicitly stating \u201cit\u2019s free\u201d increased sign-up conversions by 28 percent.\nImages on landing and product pages \u2014 A specific study involving A/B tests shows the surprising impact of using a human photo on conversion rates.\nAmount of text/pages \u2014 show that users prefered a single-page checkout by 21.8 percent.\nThere are also other usability testing tools like Optimizely (great for everything) and Unbounce (more landing page focused) that make it extremely easy to get started with A/B testing. These usability tools handle the distribution and collection of data for you, so all you have to do is wait for the results. If you\u2019re interested in a comprehensive list of website elements to test, you can also check out this detailed explanation of 71 things to A/B test.\nRun both variations at the same time \u2014 Time is a control, so doing version A first and then version B later may skew the results. Running both tests simultaneously and evenly will ensure the most accurate results.\nTest with enough people for statistical significance\u2014 As shown with this sample size calculator, you should test each variation with enough people for a 95 percent significance rate.\nTest new users \u2014 Regular users will be confused if they see a new variation, especially if you ultimately choose not to use it. Plus, there\u2019s the mere-exposure effect, in which people prefer what they\u2019re used to.\nBe consistent with variations on all pages \u2014 For example, if you are testing the placement of a call to action that appears on multiple pages, a visitor should see the same variation everywhere. Inconsistency will detract from accurate results, so don\u2019t show variation A on page one and variation B on page two.\nTailor your test length to statistical significance \u2014 Cancelling the test too early will reduce accuracy. Decide your statistical significance, then you can use this test duration calculator to get a rough timeline. Many paid online usability tools (especially Optimizely) also have a feature for calculating optimum time based on the goals.\nTo see some of these best practices put to use, check out this site containing hundreds of free A/B test case studies. Hubspot also provides a highly visual and easily digestible 27-page guide to A/B testing.\nIn the late 2000s, Dr. Bob Bailey, UX Designer and Researcher, conducted a series of studies around what he called the \u201cfirst click\u201d concept. The results of the studies were surprising, and very advantageous to anyone looking to improve their website. As it turns out, for any given task, a user\u2019s success rate is 87 percent as long as their first click is correct. If their first click was not correct, the chances for success fell to below 50 percent.\nThis type of usability testing is even more relevant if your site gets a large volume of search traffic \u2014 because your homepage probably won\u2019t be the first page users find, first click testing should ideally be done across your entire site.\nWe would consider this a \u201cnear-natural\u201d test because users are still assigned tasks (instead of just using the site for whatever purpose they please), but these tests are usually unmoderated and ran remotely in the comfort of the user\u2019s home.\nThe test itself is simple, and can be conducted with online testing tools like Chalkmark by Optimal Workshop. The software presents the user with a screenshot and a task, and then records their first click. For example, as we discuss in User Testing & Design, we asked users to find a local mechanic on Yelp and found that 24 percent of them first clicked on the Search bar (suggesting that the existing information architecture may not be clear enough).\nWrite clear task scenarios \u2014 Just like you would for a scripted usability test, make sure the participant is thinking about how to solve a problem instead of just where to click. Detail isn\u2019 required, but clarity is.\nDefine the best paths to success \u2014 Start from the homepage and plot all possible paths that will correctly accomplish each task.\nTime each task \u2014 A 90 percent first click rate on the correct label might deceptively indicate that your navigation is effective, unless you timed the test and saw it took an average of three minutes to make that first click.\nMeasure user confidence \u2014 After each task, you can ask participants to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 regarding their confidence of task completion. Any 3s and 4s will indicate navigation problems.\nFor more information on how a first click test might help, the customer experience newsletter Neo Insight wrote about the three biggest usability problems that first click testing can help solve.\nIt doesn\u2019t get more \u201cnatural\u201d than field and diary studies. Both are designed to observe a user as they behave naturally, without the interference of a testing process. The beauty of these tests is that the user never leaves their natural environment and are encouraged to act normally. The difference between the two is that field studies involve an observer going on location, and diary studies involve the participant recording their own thoughts, feelings, and opinions.\nA field study provides data you can\u2019t find anywhere else by letting you observe users in their own environment. Jared M. Spool, Founder of User Interface Engineering, believes that while standard usability tests can lead to valuable insights, the most powerful tool in the toolbox is the field study.\nWitness real user behavior in their everyday lives \u2014 In an interview setting, a user may not be aware of how they behave or how they would talk about a product in their everyday lives. However, in the field study, these behaviors are witnessed without a need for explanation.\nUnderstand the context for decisionmaking\u2014 Users aren\u2019t always aware of how external factors, like timing for example, affect their decisions. Field studies mark the times and environments of the user, and their impact can be seen during the analysis of the data, even if the user themselves doesn\u2019t know.\nScope out the competition \u2014 By observing how the user interacts with different products, you can start to notice similarities and differences, which will flesh out your data to enormous degrees.\nThe biggest downside is primarily the cost of organization and time required (they can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months). Workers have to leave the office for large periods of time, plus scheduling these studies can be troublesome.\nHowever, if you still think field studies could help with your usability goals, take a look at this helpful list of tips from the Nielsen Norman Group, and you can also follow this process for field research that helped companies like Apple, Yahoo, DirecTV, and others.\nA less-involved study of a user in their natural environment is the diary study. In this study, participants are asked to keep a diary and account for their experiences with a type of product or system. As Carine Lallemand, Researching Engineer and UX Scientist, explains in her piece for User Experience Magazine, the diary study is similar to surveys and interviews, yet is distinguished by its length and depth of user-generated research.\nA diary study captures the expectations, mindsets, moods, and social contexts that affect the user experience. A diary study might reveal that a bad mood or criticism read on the web impacted the user\u2019s assessment of the product experience, independent of the product itself.\nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re asked to improve a web application that helps product managers track progress. You could provide tape recorders and/or journals to five product managers and ask them to document anything odd or frustrating they experienced when using the application. After a few weeks, you would analyze the data and make specific recommendations.\nSignificance of participant \u2014 The quality of results depends on the quality of the participant. Because this takes a good deal of effort on their part, the participant\u2019s commitment to the project influences the outcome whether positively or negatively. On top of that, the participant\u2019s self-awareness, self-expression, and writing skill can all sway the results.\nTraining sessions \u2014 While it may sound like the participant acts independently, the truth is that a thorough training session is necessary to ensure the participant understands exactly what is expected before starting.\nAnalysis \u2014 The analysis of an entire diary is time-consuming, especially if it is hand-written.\nInclude contextual and open-ended questions in the writing prompt \u2014 Contextual questions like, \u201cWhat prompted you to use the app?\u201d give you direct insight, but open-ended questions like, \u201cWhat would you have done differently in this situation?\u201d can uncover new solutions.\nLet users decide how to record themselves \u2014 Text, online photo galleries, voice recording, even Twitter can all work. It also helps the process feel more natural and makes participants less self-conscious.\nKeep size in mind \u2014 The diary (whatever form) can be as small or large as needed. On paper, space for forty entries can be overwhelming, while ten might be more encouraging. That\u2019s also why digital methods might be better since users can use as much space as they want.\nFor a more detailed explanation, complete with hypothetical examples, check out this extensive post by UserTesting and this list of Dos and Don\u2019ts.\nWhile diary and field studies let you see the context for how and why products are used in everyday life, an eye tracking test goes into almost microscopic detail.\nAn eye tracking test is just as it sounds, tracking a user\u2019s eye movement, and more to the point where specifically they are looking. The eye tracking test is usually done in a lab environment in which hardware tracks eye movement, while heat mapping remotely tracks where users click (through software like CrazyEgg).\nUsers are predictable \u2014 As we can see by the eye tracking patterns above, people\u2019s sight follows similar trends, allowing us to plan our visual layouts for the masses. In Web UI Best Practices, we explain how to lay out a site in accordance to the popular F pattern and Z patterns.\nUsers search pages differently depending on goals \u2014 A user\u2019s eye pattern will differ depending on why they are searching a screen; for example, browsing and searching for something in particular have two different modes.\nUsers are drawn to visuals \u2014 Visuals like thumbnails or vibrant colors will attract a user\u2019s attention more than plain text, so use this accordingly.\nPeople ignore ads \u2014 In a phenomenon that Jakob Nielson calls \u201cbanner blindness,\u201d people will neglect ads habitually, so online advertisers will have to work harder.\nUnconventional products cause confusion \u2014 Being creative with the color of a link or the placement of your menu may set you apart from other sites, but it will also take the user longer to figure out how to use your product, which can be risky.\nIf you\u2019re interested in using eye tracking to help your website, it\u2019s a lot more achievable than it might seem. This instructive guide will explain how you can make eye tracking work for you. If you\u2019re more interested in a more natural test, SumoMe explains how to run a heat map study based on over 1,000,000 tests that they\u2019ve run.\nTests that observe the users in their natural (or near-natural) environments provide a specific type of data that other, more controlled tests can\u2019t access. An A/B test lets you make decisions that are informed by more thorough and statistically significant results (since you have a huge sample size).\nSimilarly, field and diary studies can provide you with unique information about your target users \u2014 namely external factors such as timing, environment, mood, etc. \u2014 that more direct card sorting or tree testing cannot.\nAs for first click and eye tracking tests, they literally let you see your website as your users do, but make sure you run other types of tests for the right context. While each of the different test types has its own advantages and disadvantages, sometimes its best to mix-and-match them to achieve results more specific to you.\nFor explanations and practical tips for 30 different types of usability tests, check out the free 109-page Guide to Usability Testing.

While Le Casque is identified largely with varietal wines and blends based on Rhone Valley grape varieties grown in the Sierra foothills, owner-winemaker Kevin Stevenson knows where to go for cabernet sauvignon, and that\u2019s Napa Valley.

We had to work to get it right. You don't go in with confidence that you are going to go there, and it will be perfect. You have the confidence to know that we will get it dialed in.\"\nWhen the series competed at Michigan in June 2012, it was the first time on the track's new pavement. The repaving began after the August 2011 race and concluded in November, giving the asphalt enough time to settle and cure during the winter months. The new surface on this 2-mile track produced record speeds. Marcos Ambrose won the pole at Michigan one year ago when he easily shattered the track qualifying record with a lap at 203.241 mph. Forty drivers in that qualifying session posted a faster speed than the previous track record of 194.232 mph, set by Ryan Newman in 2005. Nineteen", "baseline": "drivers topped 200 mph.\nHowever, teams were faced with a huge tire issue in the days leading up to the race. Several teams experienced tire blistering during Friday's practice session as well as on the extra day of practice on Thursday. NASCAR and Goodyear made the decision to use a tougher left-side tire for the race. The higher than expected speeds at Michigan caused significantly higher left-side tire temperatures and therefore blistering.\nAn additional practice was held the day before the race. Teams had 75 minutes to familiarize themselves with the new tires and make further adjustments to their race setups. Earnhardt Jr. was one of those drivers who was limited on his practice time due to engine concerns. He complained that his car wasn't as good as he wanted it to be after completing just 26 laps in the last practice.\nBut Earnhardt put on a dominating performance in the 400-mile event. He led a total of 95 laps and crossed the finish line ahead of his closest competitor, Tony Stewart, by more than 5 seconds for his 19th career Sprint Cup victory.\nRight now, Earnhardt sits fourth in the point standings.

{"prompt": "Insight: Did Conficker help sabotage Iran's nuke program?\n(Reuters) - A cyber warfare expert claims he has linked the Stuxnet computer virus that attacked Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2010 to Conficker, a mysterious \u201cworm\u201d that surfaced in late 2008 and infected millions of PCs.\nConficker was used to open back doors into computers in Iran, then infect them with Stuxnet, according to research from John Bumgarner, a retired U.S. Army special-operations veteran and former intelligence officer.\nWhile it is widely believed that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, Bumgarner wouldn\u2019t comment on whether he believes the Americans and Israelis also unleashed Conficker, one of the most virulent pieces of so-called malware ever detected. He wouldn\u2019t name the attackers he believes were behind the two programs, saying the matter was too sensitive to discuss.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office, which oversees Israel\u2019s intelligence agencies, also declined comment.\nIf Bumgarner", "baseline": "\u2019s findings, which couldn\u2019t immediately be independently confirmed, are correct then it shows that the United States and Israel may have a far more sophisticated cyber-warfare program than previously thought. It could also be a warning to countries other than Iran that they might be vulnerable to attacks.\nHis account leaves unresolved several mysteries. These include the severity of the damage that the program inflicted on Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facility, whether other facilities in Iran were targeted and the possibility that there were other as yet unidentified pieces of malware used in the same program.\nBumgarner - who wrote a highly praised analysis of Russia\u2019s 2008 cyber assault on Republic of Georgia - says he identified Conficker\u2019s link to Stuxnet only after spending more than a year researching the attack on Iran and dissecting hundreds of samples of malicious code.\nHe is well regarded by some in the security community. \u201cHe is a smart man,\u201d said Tom Kellermann, an advisor to the Obama Administration on cyber security policy and the chief technology officer of a company called AirPatrol.\nThe worm\u2019s latent state had been a mystery for some time. It appears never to have been activated in the computers it infected, and security experts have speculated that the program was abandoned by those who created it because they feared getting caught after Conficker was subjected to intense media scrutiny.\nIf confirmed, Bumgarner\u2019s work could deepen understanding of how Stuxnet\u2019s commanders ran the cyber operation that last year sabotaged an underground facility at Natanz, where Iranian scientists are enriching uranium using thousands of gas centrifuges.\nThe view that Stuxnet was built by the United States and Israel was laid out in a January 2011 New York Times report that said it came from a joint program begun around 2004 to undermine Iran\u2019s efforts to build a bomb. That article said the program was originally authorized by U.S. President George W. Bush, and then accelerated by his successor, Barack Obama.\nThe first reports that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet were greeted skeptically. There are still a handful of prominent cyber security experts, including Jeffrey Carr, the author of the book \u201cInside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld,\u201d who dispute the U.S.-Israel idea. He says that circumstantial evidence paints a convincing case that China was behind Stuxnet.\nAccording to Bumgarner\u2019s account, Stuxnet\u2019s operators started doing reconnaissance in 2007, using Duqu, which spied on makers of components used in Iran\u2019s nuclear and critical infrastructure facilities.\nIn November 2008, Conficker was let loose and it quickly spread, attacking millions of PCs around the world. Its initial task was to infect a machine and \u201cphone home\u201d with its location. If it was at a strategic facility in Iran, the attackers tagged that PC as a target. The release left millions of untagged machines infected with Conficker around the world, but no damage was done to them.\nIn March 2009, Bumgarner says, the attackers released a new, more powerful version of Conficker that started the next phase of the attack on April 1 by downloading Stuxnet onto the targeted PCs. After it completed that task, Conficker\u2019s mission on those machines was complete.\nHe did more digging, comparing date and time stamps on different versions of Conficker and Stuxnet, and found a correlation \u2014 key dates related to their development and deployment overlapped. That helped him identify April Fool\u2019s Day, April 1, 2009, as the launch date for the attack.\nBumgarner believes the attackers picked that date to send a message to Iran\u2019s leaders. It marked the 30th anniversary of the declaration of an Islamic republic by Ayatollah Khomeini after a national referendum.\nOnce Conficker had pulled Stuxnet into computers in Iran there was still one big hurdle, he said. Those infected computers weren\u2019t yet in the target - the underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.\nStuxnet was programmed to automatically jump from an infected PC to a USB drive as soon as it was put into a computer. That was the easy part. Getting somebody to be a human \u201cmule\u201d by bringing that USB drive to Natanz and plugging it into the right machine was a logistical nightmare.\nThat was probably delivered by somebody who regularly visited the facility and had reason to share information electronically - an academic affiliated with an engineering program at one of Iran\u2019s universities or a worker at a company that provided technology to the facility, according to Bumgarner. He or she was almost certainly unaware of what was happening, he said.\n\u201cIt blew their operation wide open,\u201d says Bumgarner."}

The successes of this community mean nothing if we cannot pay it forward to make a better life for our children. Ultimately, we want to keep them safe as they grow up, and, in today\u2019s world, children are all too often faced with numerous challenges to their safety and health.\nWith all the potential dangers and risks in the world, it may be a surprise to learn that the leading cause of childhood injury and death in the United States is motor vehicle crashes. Not only that, but the percentage of children killed from a motor-vehicle crash is higher on average in South Carolina than it is in other states across the country. If we are truly trying to protect our children and build them a better future, we must keep them safe on the road.\nThe best way to prevent childhood injury or death in these accidents is by what you can control: safe car seats. But, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,", "baseline": "four out of five car seats in the United States are not installed properly. Infant and toddler car seats are designed with safety in mind, but a seat that is not installed correctly will not protect the child. Correctly installed car seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71 percent for infants and 54 percent for toddlers.\nCar seat safety is a passion for our family. We have been proud to partner with Safe Kids Upstate, a member of Safe Kids Worldwide, to raise awareness of childhood injury prevention here in the Upstate over the past 20 years. Since 1988, when Safe Kids was founded by Dr. Marty Eichelberger, a pediatric trauma surgeon in Washington, D.C., the organization has helped reduce the U.S. childhood death rate from unintentional injury by 60 percent.\nIt\u2019s encouraging that so much progress has been made. But as long as there are new babies, and new parents, there is a need for education and support. Today, Safe Kids Upstate is a part of the Bradshaw Institute for Community Child Health & Advocacy and we are leading the charge locally to create inspection stations where parents can have car seats checked by certified technicians to ensure they are installed correctly.\nThanks to support from Kohl\u2019s, nine inspection stations are available across the Upstate, and we have inspected more than 15,000 car seats. There are Upstate families who have had their seats inspected, experienced an auto accident and, because of their correctly installed seat, the children in the seats did not sustain serious injuries. This direct positive outcome is exactly what we are hoping for with the creation of this program. To find a location near you, visit www.safekidsupstate.org/carseat.\nEarlier this month, we celebrated the opening of a permanent car seat inspection station at Greenville Memorial Hospital. This is the first hospital-based station in South Carolina and is the result of collaboration with several partners, including Kohl\u2019s and Safe Kids Upstate.\nOur hope is that this location will allow new parents to get their car seats inspected before ever leaving the hospital. It will keep children safe from day one, give parents peace of mind and ensure that they begin their parenting journey with knowledge about road safety and injury prevention.\nWe can\u2019t stop accidents from happening on the road, but we can take steps to prevent serious injuries or even fatalities. A correctly installed car seat is a highly effective vaccine against automotive accident injuries.

{"prompt": "Joseph Thornton, a graduate of Eastside Prep, stands outside of the Meyer Library at Stanford University, where he is busy studying for upcoming finals on December 3, 2013. It is Thornton's first semester at the university. Photo by Veronica Weber.\nJoseph Thornton could have been another statistic.\nAs a sixth grader living in San Francisco with a single father who worked nights, he was on his own a lot of the time, cooking dinners and getting himself to bed.\nBut his public school teacher spotted his unusual work ethic and \"through a blessing and good luck\" introduced him to a private school in East Palo Alto, where he could live in a dorm and get round-the-clock support.\nThornton today is a Stanford University freshman, working at the tech help desk in the undergraduate library, singing in the Black Men's Chorus a cappella group and preparing to declare a major in computer science.\nThough he always aspired to attend college and his father supported the dream, Thornton says without the extraordinary preparation he", "baseline": "got in his six years as a student at Eastside College Preparatory School, things might have turned out very differently.\n\"It definitely wouldn't have been the same -- I would have been on my own in the whole process,\" he said.\nNow in its 18th year, Eastside Prep is a one-of-a-kind institution, combining rigorous academics, an uncommon level of teacher and volunteer support and sustained investment by private donors toward a razor-sharp objective: getting first-generation college students to succeed in four-year colleges and beyond.\n\"We believe every student who becomes the first member of his or her family to go to college has a profound impact not just on that student but on the whole family,\" says Principal and co-founder Chris Bischof.\nStarting with that conviction and little else, Bischof and Eastside co-founder and Vice-Principal Helen Kim -- friends from their Stanford undergraduate days in the early 1990s -- have built this unusual school from scratch, learning and adapting along the way.\nThe two teachers had eight students when they launched their startup in 1996 at a park picnic table in East Palo Alto, later moving to borrowed office space and eventually to a few portable classrooms on a donated 1.6-acre parcel on Myrtle Street.\nFrom the picnic-table beginnings, Bischof over the years has corralled donor support to build state-of-the-art classrooms, a computer lab, a theater, a gym, a cafeteria and even a dorm -- all surrounding an open, grassy quad.\nEnrollment has grown to 300 from the original eight, with every one of Eastside's 388 alumni so far accepted by a four-year college.\nEighty-two percent of Eastside students come from East Palo Alto or eastern Menlo Park, though some of those are among the one-third of Eastside students who live in the dorm because of the extra structure and support offered there. Bischof himself has resided on campus for nearly the entire history of the school.\nIt may be only slightly accidental that many amenities available to Eastside students -- hot meals, tutorials, dorm-room inspections -- resemble those at the New England boarding school where Bischof spent his own high school years, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.\n\"There are some common elements, and differences as well,\" said Bischof when asked about the comparison.\n\"We've tried to create a school that has high expectations and is really rigorously going to prepare our students for college across the board. Having been in those environments, it helps to know what those expectations are like. And we hope that with the same expectations and the right type of support, our students can be equally successful.\"\nVice-principal Kim oversees Eastside's faculty and curriculum, including unique features like \"Friday Night Homework\" and an intensive middle-school reading program.\nReceiving no public funds, Eastside is free from the strings and bureaucracy that accompany them, allowing it wide berth to customize teaching to student needs.\nThe flip side is that Bischof must constantly fundraise -- to the tune of $17,000 per student per year -- to keep the operation afloat, a task he calls \"a huge struggle, and a real challenge from year to year.\"\nParents, most of whom are low-income, are asked to pay $250 a year -- plus an extra $100 if their child lives in the dorm -- and contribute 20 volunteer hours.\nWith 55 staff members (38 full-time-equivalents), the school's operating budget is $6.4 million, covering the year-round program, the residential program and the alumni support. It costs $10,000 to house a child in the dorm. Ninety percent of Eastside's support comes from individuals, with the balance from foundations and corporations.\nIn the case of Joseph Thornton and many others who've gone through the school, financial support came from donors who agreed to sponsor an individual student.\nWhile many of his classmates wrote their thank-you letters to anonymous sponsors, Thornton said he felt lucky that his sponsors -- a San Francisco couple with a young daughter who took him on as a seventh-grader -- wanted to get to know him personally.\nThey met for lunches and visits and, the following year, invited Thornton to an event at their home to speak about his Eastside experiences with prospective donors to the school.\n\"It went well actually,\" he said. \"I had a lot of fun, met a lot of people, and did more of it. It's a great experience because you learn how to interact with people of different backgrounds, understand their experiences and understand the whole experience of networking.\"\nThe San Francisco family kept on sponsoring him every year through high school, Thornton said, and the relationship continues today.\nAs word about Eastside has spread, admission inevitably has grown more selective.\nFirst and foremost, says Bischof, the school is looking for first-generation college-bound students from low-income families. \"Within that subset, we're looking for students who want to be here.\"\nStudents must commit to an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. school day -- plus homework -- and an academic calendar that runs year-round, including summer school or other summer activities deemed worthy. Bischof personally interviews every applicant.\n\"They're really looking for that spark in kids,\" said John Jacobs, a retired public school teacher now in his seventh year of volunteering at Eastside.\n\"Not necessarily the smartest ones, but kids they feel they can keep on a college track. They have a lot of kids -- maybe even a majority of sixth-graders -- who are not working at grade level when they come in.\"\nAcademics at Eastside combine rigor with an elaborate support structure.\n\"There are no shortcuts,\" Spanish teacher Shaneka Julian said.\nBut \"confidence-building -- defining students as intellectuals and scholars -- is a huge part of the culture,\" said Marianne Chowning-Dray, who taught calculus at Gunn High School for nine years before joining the Eastside faculty in 2005.\n\"It's assumed that everyone will participate, everyone can do this, that all students can achieve at a high level. We don't take no for an answer,\" Chowning-Dray said.\nThat culture felt strange to Thornton when he first arrived as a student. \"Normally students fear seeking help or talking to the teacher because they don't want to seem stupid or dumb for asking questions or not knowing something, but at Eastside we expected ourselves to ask these questions, we expected to meet the teacher outside of the class.\n\"They give you their email address; they give you their number. They do like sleeping, so they prefer that you contact them earlier, but if you contact them even at 10 p.m. and they're still awake they'll definitely help you out.\"\nEastside relies on volunteers to staff an intensive middle-school reading program, in which students begin their day with an hour and a half of intensive reading and writing.\nVolunteers like John Jacobs make it possible to break the students into small groups of four. \"Each morning we read a chapter out loud,\" Jacobs explained. \"We monitor the reading, we do vocabulary and comprehensive exercises and the kids do a writing response every day.\"\nVice-Principal Kim oversees \"Friday Night Homework,\" a routine that helps ensure no assignment is left undone. Students with incomplete work in any give week are required to stay on campus Friday evening until it is finished.\nSince Eastside's early days, Kim has tracked which students are missing which assignments. Now it can be done by computer.\n\"Friday afternoons we run a report of all missing assignments of all students,\" she explained. \"I do a lot of rounding up and calling parents to tell them not to pick up their student at 5 because they have to stay and complete assignments.\"\nShe considers the Friday night routine a \"safety net\" for kids who otherwise may consider the incomplete assignments \"out of sight, out of mind.\"\n\"Here, the work doesn't disappear, and if they've turned in all their assignments they're much less likely to do poorly in a class,\" she said.\nChowning-Dray, the math teacher, made the switch from Gunn to the Eastside faculty after becoming familiar with the school through helping, as a volunteer, to establish its calculus program.\n\"We built the program for AB calculus, and then they decided to expand to a BC sequence,\" she recalled, referring to the more advanced course. \"At that time I thought that would be a great match for me. It was an opportunity to reapply my skills and the knowledge I'd amassed over the years and put it toward this great mission.\"\n\"What might be assumed at another school we're very intentional about here,\" she said. \"If a student isn't doing their homework or outside assignments we notice that and try to figure out what's going on and get that student back on track.\n\"Students can fall through the cracks in a lot of schools, but I'd say Eastside is sealed really tight.\n\"I think a lot of efforts are being made in public high schools to create that sort of environment, but it's tough. What works here isn't necessarily scalable, but parts of it are. It's a lot about the people -- the longevity of the leaders, the vision of the people who work here.\"\nChowning-Dray has a total of about 100 students in her section of BC calculus and three sections of algebra II-trigonometry, as well as an afternoon study hall. At Gunn she might have had five classes with 30 students each.\nBut while they may have fewer students to keep track of, Eastside teachers and staff wear many hats.\nShaneka Julian, who teaches first-, second- and third-year Spanish to non-native speakers, also advises Eastside's Engineering Club, coaches the girls JV basketball team and fills in as a substitute dorm adviser. Bischof coaches boys basketball.\nOne of many lessons Bischof and Kim have learned is that, for first-generation students, college admission is only the start of the journey.\n\"At the beginning I was very naive and just thought if we could get them to college it would be a ticket to a better life and the rest would take care of itself,\" Bischof said. \"But we learned that first-generation college students face challenges that most of us who went to college can't even imagine.\n\"We saw some students able to be successful but others who did struggle, especially in that first year making the transition from the highly supportive environment here to a larger institution where they really were pioneers in their family and it was very easy to opt out if they didn't get off to a good start. That was eye-opening to us,\" Bischof said.\nThese days Eastside grads who are college freshmen, such as Thornton, get weekly or biweeky emails and calls from the school.\n\"They visit all the freshmen on their campuses,\" Thornton said. \"And they call you and ask 'How's everything going? What's new? Are your classes too demanding? Is everything fine at the dorm? Is anything surprising you?'\"\nFreshmen and sophomores are a particular focus, says Eastside's Alumni Program Director April Alvarez.\n\"Those first two years in college are crucial, and once they make it past that they're very likely to finish,\" she said.\nEastside staffers such as Kate Hiester also work year-round to help grads find summer internships and job leads -- much like a well-connected parent would.\nAnother post-graduate \"stabilizing force\" for Eastside alums is the fact that most enter college with some academic credit already under their belts.\nLongtime English teacher Amy Reilly recently went through the hiring process at Foothill College and now offers Eastside seniors a year of college-credit English.\nThe class, recognized by most UC campuses and all California State University campuses, is taught at Eastside but runs on Foothill's calendar. It adheres to Foothill guidelines, which include a 750-word minimum on assessed papers and a requirement that students generate at least 6,000 words per term. The first semester draws on nonfiction to cover different modes of writing -- observational, autobiographical, position papers, speculation about cause and effect and evaluation. The second semester is fiction-based, with students reading and analyzing \"Crime and Punishment,\" \"In Cold Blood,\" \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"Antigone.\"\n\"Our students are very well prepared in the humanities and this gives them even more confidence, and also room -- if they make a mistake at the beginning -- not have their financial aid frozen after a quarter or two,\" Reilly said.\nAll Eastside seniors also are required to produce a 25-page research paper using peer-reviewed literature and make a 30-minute presentation on the topic.\nAfter three decades of public school teaching -- mostly middle-school math in a tough, East Bay district -- longtime Eastside volunteer Jacobs is in a position to make comparisons.\n\"I was in a school full of tough kids. We had a good staff, good administration, but we were always plugging up holes in the dike. We couldn't do it fast enough -- you always felt you were a couple of steps behind.\n\"You have a lot of kids in the school ready to jump at a quality education, but it's very hard to provide it at the level we want to. Ten percent of the kids take up a lot of everybody's time, and you never have enough people.\"\nThe small scale of Eastside mitigates many of those factors, Jacobs said.\nCofounders Bischof and Kim are widely revered on campus.\nAt Eastside, Jacobs said, \"Kids can't walk across campus without several people saying hello and meaning it. Chris and Helen will stop and talk to them about whatever, make a connection.\n\"And they don't sit still. They're always pushing the envelope, trying to level the playing field.\"\nParent Mimi Pearson said, \"Any time Chris or Helen ask me to do anything I'm dropping everything to do it. They gave my daughters a chance, and they didn't have to. I'm never taking that for granted.\"\nAt this point the cofounders have no plans to expand or try to replicate their school but, having graduated 14 classes, are starting to see some of the long-term impact of their enterprise come into focus.\n\"We can see (graduates) advancing in their careers in the short time they've been out of college,\" Bischof said. \"They serve as role models and stay closely connected to the school.\"\nSome have remained in their college communities or moved away for professional opportunities but, he said, a majority return to the area, with many working in education. Some are teaching in East Palo Alto's Ravenswood City School District, and one even moved into the dorm along with his wife to take on the job of resident fellows.\n\"The feedback from our alumni really informs what we do at the high school level,\" he said. \"We'd be the first to say that this is a work in progress, and we continue to learn.\"\nI volunteer SS a tutor at the Project read Adult Literacy Program. One of my students, who only had 6 years of schooling in her native country, has enrolled her three children at Eastside Prep.

This past May, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Master of City Planning, focusing on economic development. I have dreams that someday my education will prepare me for a high position in energy leadership. These dreams would not be possible without the impact that Eastside had on my confidence and self-awareness.

That's a national imperative that warrants a meaningful federal role to ensure that all children are making progress every year.\nThe challenge, however, is for performance targets to reflect the aspirations and realities on the ground\u2014to be more \"bottom-up\" than \"top down.\" To that end, and recognizing that NCLB's one-size-fits-all goals were unrealistic and led to a variety of unintended consequences, we should build on the work of the current administration and negotiate performance targets at the state level.\nAny state or district that believes lower or higher performance targets are in the best interests of kids should be required to make the case to parents, educators, taxpayers, and the federal government. That way, everyone will own it.\nIt's a good thing for every state to be clear and public about how it gauges adequate school performance. However, while Congress should require this transparency, Congress should not require that the U.S. Department of Education play any role in approving these state decisions. As I see it, there are four key problems with that kind of prescriptive federal role.\nFirst, performance targets can be powerful motivators when they are concrete, when they are shared, and when the goal-setters are accountable for the results. The problem with federal involvement is that federal officials have no responsibility for meeting the goals they insist upon and no accountability if schools fail to do so. All the blame falls on local educators and on local and state officials. The result is that it's all too easy for D.C. officials to insist upon ridiculous goals. In fact, the inclination to aim high (as with NCLB's 100% proficiency targets) yields aspirational goals that are more a symbolic statement than a serious tool for improving schools or systems.\nSecond, when federal officials promulgate grand goals, real people are then required to treat these as a practical gauge of success. The Soviet Union showed where this tends to lead, as decades of ludicrous five-year plans that promised heroic increases in agricultural production produced little grain, but lots of cynicism, deception, and lies.\nThird, a federal sign-off inevitably means federal guidelines or requirements. Given the need to fit fifty states with 100,000 schools, any meaningful parameters will be too rigid to be a good fit for many systems and schools (as with NCLB's requirement that any school was failing to make AYP if any single subgroup failed to hit a proficiency bar).\nFinally, giving the feds a role in approving state targets presumes a false certainty and science when it comes to determining adequate performance. There's simply no rational basis for federal officials to insist there is a best-practice system or set of expectations. These are open questions, and we're best served by states exploring a diverse array of systems.\nLet me put it this way. The NFL season just ended. Over the next couple months, coaches should sit with their executives and owners in order to set goals regarding the kind of performance they expect to see. That process is valuable and I heartily endorse it. At the same time, I don't think it would be constructive for the Pennsylvania legislature to declare that the Eagles and Steelers need to go at least 11-5 next year."}

{"prompt": "But it's worth stepping back from Romney's specific remarks and looking at President Obama's clean-energy track record more broadly. What sorts of green jobs programs has the Obama administration spent $90 billion on? Where does it all go? How much of the funds have been wasted? And what are we actually getting in return for all this cash?\n1) The stimulus provided some $90 billion in financing for a wide array of clean energy programs. Here\u2019s the breakdown: There's $29 billion for improving energy efficiency, including home retrofits; $21 billion in incentives for renewable generation, such as solar and wind; $10 billion for modernizing the electric grid; $6 billion to promote advanced vehicles and a domestic battery industry; $18 billion for high-speed rail and other trains; $3 billion for research into carbon capture for coal plants; $3 billion for job training; and $3 billion for clean manufacturing tax credits.\nA few caveats. Not all of these programs are strictly Obama programs. Some of them were signed into law by President Bush, but didn't get funding until the stim", "baseline": "ulus was enacted. An example is ARPA-E, which conducts research into long-shot energy technologies and was first created in 2007. What's more, some programs involve loans or loan guarantees, which means the money will be repaid so long as the companies survive.\n2) The vast majority of these projects are still up and running, though there have been a few notable failures. It is not even close to true that \"half\" of the energy companies funded by the stimulus have \"gone out of business,\" as Romney said. Many of the programs, such as the tax credits and grants for wind and solar production, only pay out when the turbines and solar panels churn out electricity.\nRomney's campaign later clarified that he was solely referring to the Energy Department's 1705 loan program, which provides about $16.1 billion to clean-energy companies. Yet of the 33 companies that have received loan guarantees, just three are in bankruptcy\u2014including Solyndra, which could cost the government up to $535 million. (The other two firms are Abound Solar and Beacon Power, which is still operating and has largely repaid its federal loan.) Additional companies could eventually fail, but for now, the default rate is just 2.6 percent for one program in the stimulus.\nIt's worth noting that Congress created the 1705 loan program with the expectation that some companies would fail. The government was supposed to take risks. And, as energy analyst Gregory Kats has testified (pdf), the loan program's final cost will likely end up well below the $2.47 billion Congress set aside to cover losses.\n3) The stimulus appears to have boosted U.S. wind and solar generation. Here's Mike Grunwald with a top-line summary: \"Before President Obama took office, the U.S. had 25 gigawatts of wind power, and the government\u2019s 'base case' energy forecast expected 40 GW by 2030. Well, it\u2019s not quite 2030 yet, but we\u2019ve already got 50 GW of wind. We\u2019ve also got about 5 GW of solar, which isn\u2019t much but is over six times as much as we had before Obama.\"\nCosts are dropping, too. The price of photovoltaic systems has fallen in half, from $7.20 per watt in 2007 to $3.47 per watt in 2011, although solar is still more expensive than conventional electricity. And the cost of new wind turbines fell 27 percent from 2008 to 2011. It's difficult, however, to sort out how much of the decline was due to the stimulus and how much due to China's massive foray into wind and solar manufacturing.\nLet's also put these advances in perspective: Solar and wind still generate a small fraction of U.S. electricity\u2014just 3 percent in 2011. And it's not clear that either industry can maintain its rapid growth without further subsidies. For instance, a key tax credit for wind generation is set to sunset at the end of this year, which would slow down turbine construction dramatically, especially since wind has to compete against cheap natural gas.\n4) Other green programs in the stimulus have a murkier track record, though it could take years to see results. The Obama administration spent $2.4 billion to create a new battery industry in the United States, yet many of those factories are now running idle, thanks to weak demand for electric cars. A modern \"smart grid\" could one day enable the country to juggle intermittent power from solar and wind, but the technologies have been slow to gain a foothold. Likewise, the federal government is chipping in $3.2 billion for high-speed passenger rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles\u2014but it's uncertain if the line will ever get finished.\nAdvocates of the energy programs argue that it will take time for some investments to pan out. Electric cars, for instance, could eventually catch on. And ARPA-E is bankrolling research into novel ideas like laser drilling for geothermal energy and advanced lithium-ion batteries. Will these inventions transform the energy industry? It may take years to find out.\nOther stimulus efforts are showing signs of progress after early missteps. Back in 2009, the $5 billion home weatherization program looked like an outright disaster; in Delaware, state officials were grappling with contractors doing \"shoddy, unnecessarily expensive work.\" Since then, however, the Energy Department has managed to weatherize one million homes, saving consumers an estimated average of $400 per year on energy bills.\n5) Clean energy has received the vast bulk of government since 2009, but it hasn't always been this way. Ever since the first tariffs to protect Pennsylvania coal in the late 1700s, the U.S. government has always nurtured new energy sources. And, over the decades, fossil fuels and nuclear power have received the bulk of that support, as a report last year from the venture-capital firm DBL investors showed.\nA raw subsidy count, however, can be misleading. Government support for energy can manifest itself in all sorts of ways. Take the drilling technique known as \"fracking,\" which has led to a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas production from shale rock. That was developed by private industry with vital aid from the federal government, which contributed research, key pilot projects, and mapping assistance. Fracking took 25 years to develop and fine-tune, a product of a number of programs and collaborations\u2014a reminder that energy technology rarely develops in a straightforward, predictable fashion.\n\u2014 The stimulus isn't all that Obama has done on energy. He has also ratcheted up fuel-economy standards for automobiles to 54 miles per gallon by 2025 and enacted a number of EPA regulations on carbon and mercury that will likely hamper coal plants.\n\u2014 Here's a look at Romney's plan for North American oil independence by 2020. Also note that Romney supports ARPA-E, the $400 million program for long-shot energy research."}

{"prompt": "Mary Pezzulo over at Steel Magnificat has written an excellent piece about the problem with name-calling, contentiousness, and point-scoring in the name of \u201capologetics.\u201d I agree completely with what she says, and I recommend reading her post.\nI also want to offer a few thoughts from the other side of the aisle, as it were. If you spend a lot of time in ideologically motivated communities, you\u2019re going to encounter a lot of sanctimony and self-righteousness. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a member of 300 different Catholic FaceBook groups, or you are deeply involved in the vegan community, or you made the mistake of going to a mom\u2019s group in an upscale neighbourhood; the basic practices are the same.\nA group of people gather together and someone makes an assertion that is basically intended to signal how virtuous, well-informed, intelligent, hip, woke, or generally awesome they are. Others jump in. Some just ante-up by agreeing with the original statement and affirming it\u2019s sagacity. Others up the stakes by making", "baseline": "a claim that builds on the original assertion, showing that they not only equal the first speaker but actually exceed them. And so it goes around the table until suddenly somebody calls.\nThis could take the form of a direct call-out \u2013 accusing one of the speakers of hypocrisy or bad behaviour, or showing that actually they\u2019re exaggerating their accomplishments or commitments. It could involve pointing out a contradiction in one of the statements. It could be a flat denial of some dubious truth claim. Or it might be a pointed \u2018Socratic\u2019 question designed to expose the flaws in someone\u2019s thinking without openly telling them that they\u2019re an idiot.\nMore commonly, though, it turns out that a certain amount of bluffing was involved. And this is where things have the capacity to get ugly, because in social situations there aren\u2019t the same kind of clear hierarchies as in poker: there\u2019s not a rule-book that you can appeal to determine whether hearing Jesus speaking to you in your heart carries more, or less, weight than having discussed the question in a private audience with the Archbishop.\nSo it descends into bickering, and depending on how high the stakes are the arguments can go on for hours, or days, or months\u2026 or years\u2026 or decades. If institutional bodies get involved, a good squabble can last for centuries. The pretext is always the same: both sides insist that they are actually concerned with truth, or justice, the correction of error, or the protection of the weak. But to any onlooker with even a shred of objectivity, it\u2019s clear that actually what\u2019s at stake is the need to win back whatever social currency was put on the table. People\u2019s pride, prestige, honour or reputations are at stake and so they feel that they can\u2019t just walk away.\nThe more hurtful the situation becomes, the more invested people are. So they\u2019ll stay, even if they are being bullied, name-called, shamed, or directly threatened \u2013 because all of these things cause the stakes to go further up, and up, and up. Backing down means walking away and leaving your winnings behind (you always think of the winnings as yours, even if it\u2019s far from clear that they rightfully belong to you).\nOkay, so it\u2019s very easy to point and laugh at people who are behaving this way \u2013 and I\u2019m not even going to argue that it\u2019s wrong to do so. Part of the social process by which we learn that ridiculous behaviours are ridiculous is by finding that we have become an object of ridicule. When you\u2019ve been wounded in some com-box dust-up, and instead of rushing around to sympathize, people laugh and start singing \u201cLet it Go!\u201d it\u2019s unpleasant for sure\u2026but in retrospect, these are often the moments when we learn humility.\nBesides, if everybody behaved as if these absurd exchanges were actually legitimate contests being fought for important reasons, we would end up like the nobility of the 17th century: monumentally stupid slights would result in actual bloodshed, and there would be real debates over questions like whether a monk\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to defend his honour justified his participation in duels.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to lace our laughter with at least a touch of self-derision. Whether your response is to roll your eyes and scroll past, or grab a bag of popcorn and sit back to watch the fur fly, maybe also take a moment to say a little mea culpa. Because in one way or another, this is something we all do."}

McCready heads into the general election with $1.2 million in the bank compared to about $70,000 for Harris, a former pastor. This district went for Donald Trump by 12 points in 2016, but Democrats hold a clear edge in enthusiasm at this stage of the race. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\nWV-03: State Sen. Richard Ojeda scored a convincing victory in the Democratic primary Tuesday night, receiving 52% of the vote against three challengers. Ojeda received nearly 30,000 votes in the primary, which came close to matching the total combined votes for the top four vote-getters in the GOP primary. State Del. Carol Miller won that seven-person contest with 24% of the vote. Democrats will face an uphill climb is this southern West Virginia seat. Donald Trump carried the 3rd District by 50 points in 2016 while Mitt Romney carried it by 32 points. But Ojeda's populist platform combined with his background as a decorated Army veteran who voted for Trump could appeal in a district that was represented by former Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall until he lost his 2014 re-election bid. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\nIN-02: Three-term GOP Rep. Jackie Walorski will face off against Democrat Mel Hall in November. Hall, a former minister, received 42% of the vote in Tuesday's crowded six-candidate Democratic primary. Walorski won her last two races with comfortable margins after earning a narrow victory in 2012 to the seat vacated by current Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. Donald Trump won this district, home to South Bend and Elkhart, by 22 points. That was a dramatic swing from 2008, when Barack Obama and John McCain were separated by about 700 votes. Walorski enters the general election as a clear favorite, with a little more than $1 million in the bank as of mid-April. Hall starts off with $236,000 cash on hand, but he's shown an ability to stay competitive in fundraising the last two quarters. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\nIN-09: This is another Hoosier State race with a heavily-favored GOP incumbent and a Democratic nominee who could pose a challenge. Democrat Liz Watson, a former congressional staffer, eclipsed two other candidates with 66% of the vote in Tuesday's primary. She'll face off against first-term Rep. Trey Hollingsworth in November. Watson has outraised Hollingsworth the past two fundraising quarters, although the Republican holds a cash-on-hand advantage of $432,000 to $297,000. Hollingsworth, whose net worth is in excess of $50 million, has the ability to help his own cause if necessary. In 2016, he spent $3.1 million of his own money on his campaign.

{"prompt": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the leading provider of cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications, today released its Third Quarter, 2013 State of the Internet Report. Based on data gathered from the Akamai Intelligent Platform\u2122, the report provides insight into key global statistics such as network connectivity and connection speeds, attack traffic, and broadband adoption and availability, among many others.\nThe Third Quarter, 2013 State of the Internet Report includes insights into the likelihood of repeat DDoS attacks against an individual target, the continued attack activity by a group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army, as well as observations on Akamai traffic activity related to Internet disruptions in Syria, Myanmar and Sudan. The report also reviews mobile browser usage by network type based on data from Akamai IO.\nThe global average connection speed continued its upward trend in the third quarter of 2013, climbing ", "baseline": "10% over the previous quarter to 3.6 Mbps. A total of 122 countries/regions that qualified for inclusion saw average connection speeds increase during the third quarter, with growth ranging from 0.5 percent in Namibia (to 1.1 Mbps) to a 76 percent increase in Nepal (to 3.6 Mbps).\nAverage connection speeds saw a 29 percent year-over-year increase, with all of the top 10 countries/regions climbing 27 percent or more. Globally, 133 qualifying countries/regions saw year-over-year increases in average connection speeds, from 0.2 percent in Egypt (to 1.2 Mbps) to 259 percent in R\u00e9union (to 6.8 Mbps).\nGlobal average peak connection speeds showed a slight decline in the third quarter of 2013, dropping 5.2 percent to 17.9 Mbps. Seven of the top 10 countries/regions saw increases in average peak connection speeds during the quarter, ranging from 0.5 percent in Hong Kong (to 65.4 Mbps) to 19 percent in South Korea (to 63.6 Mbps). Meanwhile, Romania, Latvia and Belgium saw declines of 4.4, 3.3 and 3.6 percent to 45.4, 43.1 and 38.5 Mbps, respectively.\nYear over year, the global average peak connection speed grew 13 percent over the third quarter of 2012. Yearly increases among the top 10 countries/regions ranged from 15 percent in Latvia to 63 percent in Singapore. Worldwide, 115 qualifying countries/regions showed yearly growth in average connection speeds, with increases ranging from 0.3 percent in South Africa (to 11.9 Mbps) to 111 percent in Palestine (to 19.9 Mbps).\nGlobal high broadband (>10 Mbps) adoption rose 31 percent quarter-over-quarter to reach 19 percent. Global broadband (>4 Mbps) adoption improved 5.8 percent over the quarter to reach 53 percent.\n\"In the third quarter of 2013, we observed that long-term growth in average and average peak connection speeds remained strong, as did growth in global broadband and high broadband adoption rates. We believe these trends point to continued improvement in the quality and performance of Internet connectivity in countries around the world,\" said David Belson, the report's editor.\nAkamai maintains a distributed set of unadvertised agents deployed across the Internet that log connection attempts, which the company classifies as attack traffic. Based on the data collected by these agents, Akamai is able to identify the top countries from which attack traffic originates, as well as the top ports targeted by these attacks. It is important to note, however, that the originating country as identified by the source IP address may not represent the nation in which an attacker resides. For example, an individual in the United States may be launching attacks from compromised systems anywhere in the world.\nAkamai observed attack traffic originating from 185 unique countries/regions during the third quarter of 2013, up 10 over the previous quarter. China, which originated 35 percent of observed attacks, returned to the top spot this quarter after having been unseated by Indonesia in the second quarter. Indonesia, meanwhile, dropped back to second place after originating 20 percent of observed attacks \u2013 slightly more than half of the volume seen in the second quarter. The United States remained in third place as it originated 11 percent of observed attacks during the third quarter, up from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter.\nOverall, the concentration of attacks declined during the third quarter of 2013, with the top 10 countries originating 83 percent of observed attacks, compared to 89 percent in the second quarter. China and Indonesia, however, continued to originate more than half of all observed attack traffic.\nAfter dropping to third place in the second quarter, Port 445 (Microsoft-DS) returned to its spot as the most targeted port in the third quarter, drawing 23 percent of observed attacks. Port 80 (WWW [HTTP]) and Port 443 (SSL [HTTPS]) dropped to second and third place at 14 and 13 percent, respectively. Port 445 was the most targeted port in eight of the top 10 countries/regions, the only exceptions being China and Indonesia. Port 1433 (Microsoft SQL Server) was the top target for China and Port 443 was the most targeted from Indonesia.\nIn addition to observations on attack traffic, the State of the Internet Report includes insight into distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks based on reports from Akamai customers. For the first time since the fourth quarter of 2012, when Akamai began reporting on DDoS attacks, fewer attacks were reported than the previous quarter, with 281 observed in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 318 during the second quarter (down 11 percent). Overall, Akamai saw more attacks through the third quarter of 2013 (807) than it did in all of 2012 (768).\nThe Enterprise sector continued to be the leading target of DDoS attacks with 127 reported in the third quarter; Commerce was next with 80, followed by Media & Entertainment (42), Public Sector (18) and High Tech (14).\nAkamai has also started to examine the likelihood that attack targets may be subject to follow-up attacks. Out of the 281 third-quarter attacks, 169 were focused on unique targets. During the quarter, 27 customers were attacked for a second time; five reported three attacks; and seven companies were attacked more than three times. Initial analysis of the data indicates that if a company is the target of a DDoS attack, there is a 25 percent chance that it could be attacked again within three months.\n\"Although the number of DDoS attacks reported by Akamai customers in the third quarter declined from the previous quarter, we believe that 2013 will ultimately be a significantly more active year for DDoS attacks than 2012,\" Belson said. \"As of the end of the third quarter, customers had already reported more DDoS attacks than they did in all of 2012.\"\nMore than 760 million unique IPv4 addresses from 239 unique countries/regions connected to the Akamai Intelligent Platform during the third quarter of 2013, a 1.1 percent increase over the second quarter and an 11 percent increase year over year. Since a single IP address can represent multiple individuals in some cases \u2013 such as when users access the Web through a firewall or proxy server \u2013 Akamai estimates the total number of unique Web users connecting to its platform during the quarter to be well over one billion.\nThe number of unique IPv4 address seen by the Akamai Intelligent Platform worldwide rose by more than eight million over the quarter, with growth observed in six of the top 10 countries. Year over year, the number of global unique IPv4 addresses connecting to Akamai grew by more than 123 million, with nine of the top 10 countries/regions showing growth.\nFor the first time, the State of the Internet Report includes data leveraged directly from the Akamai Intelligent platform to provide insights into IPv6 adoption across numerous vectors. European countries have taken a clear lead in IPv6 adoption, with seven of the top 10 countries. Conversely, only one country in Asia Pacific (Japan) is among the top 10.\nOver the course of the third quarter of 2013, IPv6 traffic levels on the Akamai Intelligent Platform grew from just over 176,000 hits/second to more than 277,000 hits/second. IPv6 traffic continued to exhibit a cyclical weekly pattern, with volumes dipping each Saturday, likely indicating a greater level of IPv6 adoption across corporate/enterprise networks than consumer ISPs.\nAkamai expects to include this information, as well as insight into IPv6 adoption trends over time, within the State of the Internet Report going forward.\nAverage connection speeds on surveyed mobile network operators during the third quarter of 2013 ranged from a high of 9.5 Mbps to a low of 0.6 Mbps, while average peak connection speeds ranged from 49.8 Mbps to 2.4 Mbps. Eighteen operators showed average connection speeds in the broadband (>4 Mbps) range. According to data collected by Ericsson, the volume of mobile traffic increased by approximately10 percent during the third quarter and grew by 80 percent year over year.\nAnalysis of Akamai IO data collected during the third quarter shows that Android Webkit-based browsers accounted for nearly 38 percent of all requests and Apple Mobile Safari slightly less than 24 percent. When accounting for mobile device usage across all networks (not just cellular), Apple Mobile Safari comprised just over 47 percent of requests and Android Webkit made up 33 percent of requests.\nTo complement the report, Akamai's State of the Internet app was introduced today; a new app that brings the State of the Internet Report to users' iPhones and iPads. The app provides easy access to interactive State of the Internet Report data such as unique IP addresses, attack volume, connection speeds and broadband adoption, along with current and past quarterly reports as well as related news.

{"prompt": "The US National Security Agency wants a quantum computer \u2013 and has dedicated &dollar;79.7 million to the technology, according to the latest top secret government documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to the Washington Post.\nIt is no surprise that the NSA is pursuing such a potentially powerful technology, nor does the revelation pose an immediate privacy threat \u2013 the documents suggest that the agency is no closer to perfecting the technology than university researchers around the world. But if the agency does eventually realise its goal, what do citizens need to watch out for? And is there technology that would allow people to stay safe from quantum spooks?\nQuantum computers promise to vastly outperform even the best ordinary computers at specific tasks by exploiting the weird properties of quantum mechanics. While a regular PC computes with bits that are either 0s or 1s, quantum machines use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both simultaneously, and offer a computational speed-up.\nOne area quantum computers should excel in is factoring numbers into their prime building blocks. That could make them capable of breaking the internet\u2019s most commonly used encryption methods, which depend on the fact that ordinary", "baseline": "computers can\u2019t find prime factors quickly. So in principle, the NSA could use a quantum computer to read secret data \u2013 without the need to collude with tech firms, which they have done in the past.\nThe NSA programme, called \u201cPenetrating Hard Targets\u201d, apparently aims to build a quantum computer big enough to outperform the conventional variety. However, the Snowden documents, which are dated 2011, only mention aspirations for a machine consisting of two working qubits \u2013 far too small to factorise the large numbers that ordinary computers struggle with. It is also smaller than some of the quantum computers that university researchers are working with.\nIt is possible that the NSA has made progress since then, or has other technologies not mentioned in the documents. But Scott Aaronson, a quantum computer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told the Washington Post that he is doubtful that they could be taking the lead yet. \u201cIt seems improbable that the NSA could be that far ahead of the open world without anybody knowing it,\u201d he said.\nAnother quantum tool that might interest the NSA is Grover\u2019s algorithm, a database search algorithm that is theoretically much faster than any ordinary software. Snowden\u2019s leaks have revealed that the NSA runs vast data collection programmes, so any way to sift through the noise and quickly identify targets would benefit their efforts.\nHowever, the biggest Grover implementation so far, on a system of three qubits, can only search through eight database elements \u2013 in other words, this algorithm is nowhere near outperforming ordinary computers given existing, known quantum hardware.\nHowever, if the NSA does ever manage to build a much bigger quantum computer, there is still one technology that could help keep data secure, and it also relies on quantum mechanics. Quantum key distribution uses photons to generate a sequence of 0s and 1s that serve as an encryption key. Anyone attempting to intercept the key will unavoidably disturb the photons, revealing that the data has been tampered with \u2013 the laws of physics keep you safe.\nThis ultra-secure cryptography is already commercially available, and was even used to secure a Swiss election in 2007. But there are limits \u2013 building a global quantum network to rival the internet, rather than a small local network, would require technologies that do not exist yet.\nEven if we end up with a secure quantum internet, it is still possible that the NSA might find a way to snoop. Although the underlying physics is secure, physical systems might not be. Quantum hacking is possible by predicting and exploiting flaws that are likely to exist in the way the hardware implements the physics \u2013 and the NSA knows it. According to the Snowden documents, one of its research goals is to \u201csupport the development of novel Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) attacks and assess the security of new QKD system designs\u201d."}

{"prompt": "Growing up on Chicago\u2019s North Side, \u201cRocky\u201d Yamanaka recalled few incidents of racism. \u201cMe and my sister were the only Japanese. But we were curiosities to most of the Caucasians there,\u201d he said.\nFollow the story of \u201cRocky\u201d Yamanaka, one of the few remaining Nisei who remembers life in Chicago before Japanese American resettlement, from his family\u2019s difficulties in the Great Depression, his experiences in being drafted on V-J Day at the end of World War II, and his return to a Chicago that had drastically changed.\nStill sharp of mind and looking rather spry for an 86-year-old, Yamanaka, with his thin frame and graying hair, remembers a time before World War II when fewer than 400 Japanese Americans called Chicago their home. Currently, there are only a handful of Chicago Nisei from before the war that are still alive today.\nHe was born in 1927 in the U.S. to parents who hailed from near Tokyo. His father first arrived in Chicago as a houseboy living with an American family", "baseline": "in the early 1900s. Eventually obtaining an education and opening up a restaurant in the downtown area of Chicago, his father later married his mother and brought her back to the U.S. They would have two sons and two daughters, and Rocky was the third-oldest of his siblings.\nThe diner owned by his father was on Clark Street near Chicago Avenue, and served American fare typical of the many restaurants run by Nisei at the time, since an American audience for Japanese food had not developed in the 1920s and 1930s. But following the Great Depression, his father would eventually lose the restaurant, though he ended up working for another Nikkei restaurateur.\nBy this time his family had moved from the south end of downtown and settled in a crowded, coal-heated two-flat in the Geneva Terrace neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. Walking a block and a half to Lincoln Elementary School, he went to classes in a predominantly Caucasian community.\nHis childhood memories included playing \u201ckitten ball\u201d (also known as \u201cmushball,\u201d a form of 16-inch softball popular in Chicago) with Caucasian neighborhood kids. Early on he evinced a talent for drawing, and even received a summer scholarship to take a class at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nYet through his childhood, experiences of racism on the basis of his Japanese ancestry seemed rare, perhaps owing to the fact that the small Nikkei community was not seen as much of a threat in Chicago compared to areas on the West Coast, where virulent anti-Japanese sentiment had been the norm.\nThough his childhood friends tended to be Caucasian, he does remember attending Japanese American events, including community picnics with his family, as well as annual ceremonies honoring the Japanese emperor\u2019s birthday held on the South Side of Chicago. Another important memory involved going with a large group of Japanese to the 1933 Chicago World\u2019s Fair to see the Japanese Pavilion there, and having iced green tea for the first time, a relative novelty at the time.\nWhen Rocky turned ten years old, his older brother developed rheumatic fever, a common childhood illness of the period. His brother ended up being treated at the La Rabida Sanitarium in Jackson Park (now the La Rabida Children\u2019s Hospital), and since his family didn\u2019t have a car, it would take them hours by streetcars to go that far south. Later his brother returned home and though bedridden for a while, recovered enough to go to school. Despite his seeming recovery, his condition worsened and he passed away in May 1938.\nFollowing the passing of his brother, his mother got ill for a long time, and then when she recovered, his father also got sick, due to an ulcer exacerbated by these family stresses. Rocky\u2019s father would eventually pass away in December 1939. Both his father and brother were interred at Montrose Cemetery, one of the few cemeteries that accepted Japanese American remains for interment.\nThrough assistance from the Japanese Mutual Aid Society of Chicago, his family eventually stayed in an apartment on Oak Street that the association ran. This experience provided his first significant exposure to the Nikkei community and through his time there he met other Nisei like himself.\nHe would eventually learn a little of the Japanese alphabet there but never learned to speak Japanese like some of his Nisei friends. They stayed at the association from about 1939 through 1941, before his mother finally found employment.\nWhen Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, his family still lived at the association. Though he was only 14 years old at the time, he can still recall his thoughts today.\nLacking a strong family connection to Japan and being situated in the Midwest, the unfolding of the war seemed somewhat far away to Rocky as he went to high school.\nAfter his mother got a job they were able to rent a place on nearby Wells Street. His mother faced a great deal of difficulty in picking up after his father passed away, but she eventually worked in the restaurant business and ended up managing a restaurant after a couple of years, demonstrating her tenacity in the face of their family struggles.\nDuring this time he attended Waller High School (now called Lincoln Park High School), first at the Waller branch before transferring to the main school for his last two years. At this school he met a number of other Nisei who attended as well.\nBy the time that he graduated high school in the spring of 1944, he fully expected that he would be drafted into the war effort.\nDespite the war ending, Rocky still had to get inducted to fulfill his Selective Service duties. As he noted, he and his fellow enlistees were supposed to be sent to nearby Fort Sheridan by noon of that day.\nFollowing this, the Army sent him to Camp Fannin in Tyler, Texas, where supplies ran low due to the consolidation of the armed forces at the end of the war. Three months later the Army transferred him to Fort Snelling in Minnesota, but since he couldn\u2019t speak Japanese he couldn\u2019t join the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) program. By the end of his service he ended up at the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) school at Camp Holabird in Maryland and joined the art department, becoming a staff sergeant, and the head non-commissioned officer there.\nIn 1947 he finished his military service. Still only 20 years old, he found that his hometown had drastically changed.\nIn speaking about the Nikkei that ended up resettling in Chicago from the Japanese American concentration camps, \u201cEven before I got drafted they started coming into this area out of the camps. A lot of them moved to the South Side, like the Hyde Park area.\u201d By 1947, the number of Nikkei in Chicago had rocketed to some 20,000 people.\nLater he went to art school on the G.I. Bill and started a career as an illustrator at an art studio run by a former Disney animator.\nAll told, however, the Nikkei community had changed drastically from what he had known before. \u201cThe pre-war community no longer existed when I came back,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did have a community, because I lived in a Caucasian neighborhood, but I had to move into a Nisei group. Then I went in the Army and came back and the Nisei group was completely changed from what I remembered from two years before.\nDespite the changes that have taken place in the Nikkei community of Chicago, Rocky continues to live as an embodiment of an era now gone, but for him, and thankfully because of him, it will not be forgotten.\nRyan Masaaki Yokota is editor of Nikkei Chicago, a website devoted to telling the untold stories of Japanese Americans in the Windy City.

{"prompt": "Regular listeners to our weekly TechRadio podcast will know all about 3D in the home \u2013 for simplicity let\u2019s call it H3D. Over the past five years we discussed it as an emerging technology, a mature technology and, this year, an industry folly. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re modish, it\u2019s that H3D\u2019s stakeholders in manufacturing and media failed to address the three \u2018c\u2019s of cost, convenience and content that have defined the format wars of the last 30 years. Where 3D in the cinema \u2013 C3D for our purposes \u2013 has proven popular as a premium offering for multiplexes, the same enthusiasm has not crossed over to H3D where consumers don\u2019t have massive screens with digital projection, cutting-edge sound systems and a, most import, a communal viewing experience. C3D is popular because it delivers on all those fronts and viewers haven\u2019t grown tired of paying the extra \u20ac2 or \u20ac3 to catch a summer blockbuster in a prime time slot. Would anyone care tomorrow if C3D disappeared? I have yet to meet anyone who", "baseline": "said it enhanced their enjoyment of a story.\nAlthough we\u2019re stuck with C3D for the foreseeable future, the rules for home entertainment have always been different, the assumption H3D would follow the same path as C3D has proven disastrous. In the video format war of the early 1980s, VHS (developed by JVC) smashed (Sony\u2019s) Betamax as it was cheaper to produce and better manufacturer support. In the 90s, DVD beat VHS without resistance by delivering superior quality at comparable prices at a fraction of the size of a video cassette with broad manufacturer support.\nIn the noughties, Sony\u2019s Blu-ray and Toshiba\u2019s HD DVD echoed the struggle of 20 years previous, only this time around it was content deals via Sony\u2019s industry partnerships, not demand and price, that carried the day. However, consumers haven\u2019t taken to Blu-ray owing to higher prices, limited selection and changing viewing patterns in favour of on-demand services delivering mostly standard definition content. With home H3D dependent on Blu-ray adoption its best is a subset of a minority interest format. And that\u2019s before we get to the hardware.\nManufacturers have spent the past four years extolling the virtues of H3D, treating it as an inevitable evolution of home cinema systems, however the sales of 3D TVs have proved unconvincing. Studios are apparently reluctant to support H3D as it would detract from C3D revenue and Internet-connected TVs with direct access to catch-up and on-demand services are proving far more popular and cost-effective. And, of course, there is the issue of having to wear expensive active shutter glasses to get the best H3D picture.\nPanasonic, Samsung, Sony and LG still promote 3D sets on their websites but the current slate of offline advertising campaigns has put the focus on picture quality and better user experience through gesture control and Internet connectivity. Sony, however, is looking beyond H3D to refocus on picture quality: ultra-HD \u2013 or 4K \u2013 TVs.\nHowever, the final blow to H3D was delivered last week when broadcasters ESPN and BBC decided they would no longer be producing 3D content. Sky\u2019s commitment remains but with no further players committing to broadcast the content end of the argument seems to be wrapped up.\nOverpriced and underserved, H3D will be seen as a failure driven by industry hype over consumer demand.

It\u2019s not just some policies, such as maximum-minimum sentencing, that have curdled.\nSurprisingly for someone once judged so astute, Clinton seemingly had not anticipated Craig Melvin\u2019s questions on Monica Lewinsky. Instead of saying he apologized then and remains sorry today, a reasonable outreach even if he felt unfairly blindsided, the former president leaned in to defend himself, note his $16 million in legal fee debt and compare the media circus surrounding his personal scandals to the attention paid to the transgressions of the current White House occupant.\nThat Clinton charm was nowhere to be found.\nIt\u2019s true that Donald Trump faces his own litany of accusers, including former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, now suing the president for defamation (a judge has ruled Trump can be deposed), a profane \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, and a Cabinet and staff marked by accusations of incompetence and corruption \u2014 with EPA chief Scott Pruitt and the Russia investigation making daily headlines.\nClinton\u2019s supporters would take his flaws over Trump\u2019s mountain of political and personal indignities, especially if you throw in more judges such as Clinton Supreme Court pick Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nBut a game of \u201cwhataboutism\u201d and a reminder from Bill Clinton of all the women he hired and promoted does not excuse Clinton\u2019s reckless behavior with a White House intern in her 20s when he was the president of the United States. Saying that two-thirds of the American people were on your side makes you sound a little too much like another president who measures success by crowd size and ratings.\nLewinsky has found her public voice in recent years, in a TED Talk on shame and bullying, and a Vanity Fair article recognizing the power imbalance in a relationship she nevertheless and forthrightly has owned as consensual. She has earned it after a life upended and then reclaimed, for the years in which she certainly paid a higher price than the adult president in the room.\nHer words resonate with a generation of women and men who are discussing relationships \u2014 healthy, toxic and in-between \u2014 and finding their way on what is and is not acceptable at work and in life. And they vote. Few of these voters have any nostalgia or patience for Bill Clinton and have moved on to craving new voices and politicians.\nOn CNN, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, when asked about Clinton\u2019s TV appearance, said the former president should make things right with Lewinsky: \u201cI was raised that when you screw up and you make a mistake, you say sorry, and if it\u2019s not good enough for the person you are apologizing to, you keep saying sorry until they feel comfortable and you are recognizing that you made a mistake.\u201d Clinton has followed his initial words with versions of a walk-back \u2014 on CNN and in a visit with Stephen Colbert \u2014 but if he thought he would get a pass, he was mistaken.\nAny hope for a Democratic wave in the fall depends on enthusiasm from women and young voters who are looking to the future rather than the past. The result of Tuesday\u2019s primaries in California and other states show tough races across the country. So expect Bill Clinton to be the invisible man on the campaign trail, as nervous Democrats who want to offer fresh ideas show little interest in half-hearted apologies from a tainted surrogate.\nBill Clinton himself has acknowledged that much has changed in 20 years \u2014 in a good way."}

It's through its indirect weight-loss benefits,\" she said. \"If the keto diet is done without a weight-loss goal, it might not impact blood pressure at all. Losing weight remains the number one intervention, followed by lowering salt and exercising to improve blood pressure.\" Dr. Petre added that the keto diet will lower blood pressure thanks to the weight loss, not because of the ketones in the blood as a result of being in ketosis.\nHowever, the keto diet may not be the best one for weight loss for those with high blood pressure. Nieca Goldberg, MD, medical director of the Joan H. Tisch Center For Women's Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, recommends the DASH diet instead. The DASH diet stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, which is a Mediterranean-style diet that's rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and lean meat and low in salt.

{"prompt": "September 3, 2014: The ferocity with which some Western (and nearly all Arab) military analysts attack Israeli efforts to defend themselves is remarkable, and often spectacularly wrong. Even Israeli systems that are purely defensive are subject to ferocious, and usually false, criticism. One of the worst recent examples were the critics who claimed that it was technically impossible for the Israeli Iron Dome anti-rocket system to shoot down Palestinian rockets aimed at populated areas. Even after other technical experts pointed out the technical and statistical flaws in these criticisms the claims kept coming. Israelis didn\u2019t much care since each day (and night) of the recent war with Hamas anyone in southern Israel could see Iron Dome in action and doing what it was designed to do. Despite all the long range rockets fired at distant (but much larger) cities, none hit and many were spectacularly destroyed before many witnesses by Iron Dome.\nThe Israelis believe in Iron Dome, so much so that because of some decisions earlier in the year Israel was, in the week after the war began, to increase the number of Iron Dome anti-ro", "baseline": "cket missile batteries by 43 percent (from seven to ten). Israel has long wanted fifteen batteries of Iron Dome but that was going to cost more than Israel could afford. Earlier this year the U.S. agreed to help out and Iron Dome production was immediately increased. Earlier, between 2009 and July 2014, Israel received eight Iron Dome batteries and about two thousand Tamir missiles. Even so over a thousand Tamir missiles had been used (the end of June 2013) since the system entered regular service in 2011. The latest war with Hamas began on July 8th as Hamas ceased even pretending to halt the rocket attacks (by non-Hamas Islamic terrorists) on Israel coming out of Gaza. Hamas began firing a lot more rockets and the seven Iron Dome batteries in service were the primary defense against a rocket hitting an inhabited area. One additional battery had already been delivered but was not activated yet.\nAt that point Israelis really, really wanted more Iron Domes batteries. So the air force and the manufacturers went to work. Inventory was checked and it was found that there was enough equipment in stock (newly manufactured, used for development work or almost completed) to quickly equip two more batteries. Because there were already seven batteries active and personnel had been selected, trained and assembled for the new eighth battery it was calculated that by prying away a few key people from each of the eight existing batteries, activating reservists with Iron Dome experience, using some contractor personnel (civilians who had worked on Iron Dome even if they had not done so while in the military) and calling in some military personnel with similar skills (maintenance, operations) to those used by Iran Dome crews the new batteries could be staffed. By speeding up the training and certification of the eighth battery as well as the newly formed two batteries all were in action in a week or less. The eighth and ninth batteries went online by the 11th and the tenth battery was active by the 15th. Military and contractor personnel. Instructors and the new crews had to work round the clock for over a week to make it happen. More manufacturing personnel were brought in to speed up production of the Tamir missiles and components for the radars and fire control systems.

But he's dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say.\nTrump's fixation has been a drag on the momentum of his opening days in office, with his exaggerations about inauguration crowds and false assertions about illegal balloting intruding on advisers' plans to launch his presidency with a flurry of actions on the economy. His spokesman Sean Spicer has twice stepped into the fray himself, including on Tuesday, when he doubled down on Trump's false claim that he lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally cast ballots.\n\"He believes what he believes based on the information he was provided,\" said Spicer, who provided no evidence to back up the president's statements. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have finalized their election results with no reports of the", "baseline": "kind of widespread fraud that Trump is alleging.\nIf the president's claim were true it would mark the most significant election fraud in U.S. history - and ironically, would raise the same questions about Trump's legitimacy that he's trying to avoid. Yet Spicer repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether the Trump administration would investigate the allegations pushed by the president.\nSome Trump allies say Trump is justified in using his platform to defend his standing. They point to Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis' pre-inauguration statement that he did not see Trump as a legitimate president, as well as U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia meddled in the election in order to help Trump win.\n\"Segments of his own government keep driving this narrative,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant. \"I don't think it hurts to point it out.\"\nKey advisers in Trump's inner circle concede the focus on crowd claims and alleged voter fraud have been a distraction. But who's going to stop him from airing his complaints?\nAfter relishing in Friday's inaugural festivities, the new president grew increasingly upset the next day by what he felt was \"biased\" media coverage of women's marches across the globe protesting his election, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Trump was particularly enraged with CNN, which he thought was \"gloating\" by continually running photos of the women's march alongside the smaller crowds that attended his inauguration the day before, according to this person, one of several White House aides and associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\nTuesday night on Twitter, Trump slammed CNN again, referring to the network as \"FAKE NEWS @CNN\" while praising rival Fox News Channel.\nTrump has had a tumultuous relationship with the press, frequently calling the media dishonest and insulting individual reporters by name at his rallies and on Twitter. Still, two people close to Trump said he expected his coverage to turn more favorable once he took office. Instead, he's told people he believes it's gotten worse.\nThe bad press over the weekend has not allowed Trump to \"enjoy\" the White House as he feels he deserves, according to one person who has spoken with him.\nThe result has been a full display of Trump's propensity for exaggeration and more. During an appearance at the CIA Saturday, he wrongly said the inaugural crowds gathered on the National Mall stretched to the Washington Monument, despite clear photo evidence to the contrary. And during a reception with lawmakers from both parties Monday night, he repeated his false assertion that millions of illegal immigrants provided Hillary Clinton's margin in the popular vote.\nIt's not the first time that Trump, who is known to be both thin-skinned and dedicated to polishing his public image, has become fixated on details that challenge his success. When journalist Timothy O'Brien wrote in a 2005 book that Trump was a multimillionaire, not a billionaire, the real estate mogul sued him for $5 billion. The case was dismissed. Trump appealed, accusing the journalist of libel. He lost that, too.\nSpicer hinted at Trump's feelings during his maiden press briefing on Monday.\n\"There is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has,\" Spicer said. \"And I think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.\"\nLess than one week into the administration, Spicer has twice been sent to the White House briefing room to reiterate his boss' message. Trump is said to have approved of Spicer's angry tirade against the media on Saturday, which included false statements about the size of inaugural crowds. But the president, who is intensely focused on optics, was said to be critical of Spicer's on-camera image.\nBy Monday, Spicer was donning a darker suit and his lectern in the briefing room had been lowered somewhat.\nUnderscoring Trump's habit of stoking rivalries among his staff, he has told people he wants his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, to be on television more. He cheered her use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" in a recent interview as a way to counteract what he believes is the media's inherent bias.\nThose around Trump are trying to get the cable news consumer-in-chief to be near a television less often, according to one person who has spoken with him."}

For women, it means narrower access not just to abortion but also to contraception, which in many poor countries is largely funded by foreign donors.

{"prompt": "By Kathie Klarreich Kathie Klarreich, a journalist who lives in Haiti, is cofounder of Caribbean Exchange, a San Francisco-based education and action group.\nHAITIAN President General Prosper Avril completed a year in office Sept. 17. He has managed to survive several coup attempts, a crippling economic decline, and an increase in the random violence that drains the country morally and materially. The same hope that sprang up in February 1986 when Jean Claude Duvalier fled the country reappeared when Mr. Avril took office. There was some general housecleaning, as low-ranking soldiers ousted superiors with Duvalierist ties. But Avril himself, with 30 years of service to the Duvalier regime, was suspect. People took a wait-and-see attitude.\nNow even Avril's most vocal critics acknowledge certain improvements. Most recently, the president agreed to substantially cut official salaries, and halve his own, to help fight the country's huge deficit. But many promises have yet to be realized. The result is widesp", "baseline": "read discontent, increased repression, and political instability.\nAlready the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Haiti's economic situation continues to deteriorate. Coffee, one of Haiti's main exports, can no longer compete on the world market. Currently, Haiti imports nearly twice as much as it exports in order to feed its people. The market is flooded with free or low-cost staple foods that have undercut an already unstable local market.\nIn the capital city, nightly murders, robberies, and rapes force people inside when the sun goes down. Both the elite bourgeois and the penniless beggar are victims of this rising insecurity. One facet of the situation is increased banditry, perhaps a desperate response to the decaying economy. Another is the insidious attempt to keep people from organizing for democratic reform. Most of the rural organizations that formed after Duvalier's departure have collapsed.\nOne significant difference in this current wave of violence is the difficulty of tracing its source. Though there are no fingerprints leading to the National Palace, official passivity and mock investigations suggest some sort of collusion, if not direct involvement.\nIronically, from the beginning Avril has expressed an interest in the transition to a civilian government. He is proud of the Provisional Electoral Council, which this month will announce the electoral calendar. While the government insists on the council's honest intentions and independence, Duvalierist sympathizers and death-squad members have been reported present at several council meetings. These thugs made it clear that, despite a constitutional provision prohibiting anyone linked to Duvalier from participating, they intend to run for office.\nThe US, meanwhile, continues to praise President Avril. The deputy assistant secretary of state for the Caribbean, Richard Melton, recently said the US fully supports the efforts of Avril to move forward on democratic, social, and economic reforms.\nFree and fair elections are a precondition for resumption of US aid, which was cut off after an election-day massacre in November 1987. The US also demands reduced drug trafficking and improved human-rights conditions.\nEncouraged by Haiti's cooperation in drug control, the US recently approved $300,000 to help in this effort. The money will be used to expand the government's ability to track down dealers. Critics, however, question how the money will be kept out of the pockets of government employees, who are themselves often part of the drug trafficking.\nHuman-rights violations are numerous as ever. Illegal arrests average one a day; arbitrary detentions and assassinations are common. In the countryside, the victims are usually members of peasant and church groups and labor unions, and those who participate in political demonstrations.\nWhether as a result of politics or economics, more people than ever are fleeing the country by boat. In the first six months of this year, 20,530 Haitians on some 300 boats were stopped by the US Coast Guard.\nThere is little question that Haiti desperately needs economic assistance to get back on its feet. But if the US blindly doles out dollars it risks perpetuating a system that is doing nothing for its 6 million poor. Given the current situation, Haitians have little reason to feel optimistic that either their economic or political situation is likely to change in the near future."}

{"prompt": "Outside of the ocean floor, there are no empty spots on a map of Earth. At one time, of course, that was not the case. As little as a 150 years ago, most of the western United States and Canada's far north were vast white spaces on maps. It took centuries for explorers to answer the most basic questions about North America: What's there and where is it?\nDerek Hayes's \"America Discovered\" is a fascinating look at the evolution of North America as seen through the eyes of European explorers and mapmakers. He presents approximately 300 maps created over the past five centuries. It is a stunning collection that shows mapmaking not simply as the utilitarian necessity that it was, but also as an art form. In fact, given some of the flights of fancy that mapmakers indulged in when filling those empty spaces, some maps were more art than reality.\nHayes's commentary moves chronologically, beginning with the few maps we have from early Viking exploration of North America. He then moves on to Christopher Columbus, who technically didn't reach North America itself, but", "baseline": "rather islands off the continent.\nAs Hayes illustrates, the next centuries saw a slow process to determine how big the continent was, how it might be traversed, and what resources could be exploited.\nAlthough many have a romantic view of these early explorers, Hayes makes it clear that nearly all exploration was driven by the profit motive. Explorers wanted to know what was over the next hill in hopes of being able to sell it back in Europe or somehow make money from settlers. \"Without that investment,\" he notes, \"little exploration would have occurred.\"\nStill, the maps often reflected desire more than reality. After explorers realized that North America wasn't Asia, they searched for a route to China. Rivers, bays, and straits not fully explored were reported back in Europe as paths across the continent. Those searching for riches placed nonexistent cities of gold and silver on their drawings.\nExploration dispelled some myths but propagated others, such as the belief that California was an island, a fantasy that persisted for nearly two centuries. Complicating matters was the fact that some nations hid their maps from the world, causing a few explorers to \"discover\" parts of North America repeatedly.\nAlthough maps are the stars of this book, Hayes's illuminating commentary is equally good. His training as a geographer and the four previous historical atlases he has edited have prepared him well.\nWhile he concentrates his chronicle on the better-known explorers and mapmakers, he doesn't ignore the unique stories of men unfamiliar to most of us, such as Arctic explorer John Franklin, mapmaker John Barnwell, and fur trader Peter Pond.\nBeautifully produced with large color reproductions, \"America Discovered\" traces the exploration of North America and what its explorers desired as the geography was gradually revealed. It's a wonderful introduction for those interested in learning how humanity filled in those mysterious white spaces."}

If they tried to send a political message by closing our office in Gaza, it would be absolutely ludicrous.\nBut, he added, \"the two media offices ignored the government's calls and kept on with their unethical and unprofessional behaviour and policies, as they deliberately tried to implicate the government as interfering in Egypt's ongoing internal conflict\".\nHamas, which has been in control in Gaza since June 2007 and is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been repeatedly accused of interfering in internal Egyptian affairs.\nAl Jazeera recently reported that deposed Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi has been arrested on a number of charges, the most significant of which is his alleged conspiracy with Hamas to carry out \"anti-state acts\" including attacks on police stations, soldiers and prisons.\nGhussein emphasised that the government's policy is to not interfere in other states' internal affairs. The media outlets, according to Ghussein, \"falsely and deliberately\" portrayed the Hamas government as interfering in Egypt, thereby provoking resentment against it.\nMaan's editor-in-chief Nasser Al-Lahham criticised the decision to close the two offices, saying the move represents \"a continuation of Hamas government's crackdown on journalists and press freedoms\".\nSince coming to power, Hamas has restricted press freedoms in the Gaza Strip. These include an ongoing ban on importing three local newspapers printed in the West Bank, and a ban on Palestinian journalists from working, giving interviews or cooperating with Israeli press and television. Hamas has repeatedly stated it will not lift the ban on the three allegedly pro-Fatah newspapers until the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah lifts a similar ban it has enforced on pro-Hamas newspapers in the West Bank.\nLahham said Hamas' media office has \"consistently\" interfered with Maan's work over the past years, especially since the July toppling of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. \"Some Hamas officials in Gaza have apparently gone mad and started behaving irrationally after the recent events ended Morsi's and the Muslim Brotherhood's rule in Egypt,\" he commented.\nSimilarly, Al Arabiya's correspondent dismissed the government's claims of fabricating stories about the government and its relationship with Egypt as \"unfounded\".\nOn July 24, Maan News Agency published a news report citing an unnamed Israeli source and stating that \"six Muslim Brotherhood officials had smuggled themselves into Gaza to plan an uprising against the military in Cairo, after their Egyptian president was deposed\".\nWhen this later proved to be spurious, Maan responded that the story was originally published by an Israeli news site - which it has not named - and that Maan merely translated the report from Hebrew to Arabic, as per its policy.\nAlthough the government filed a complaint against Maan and Al Arabiya more than a month before this incident, Salama Marouf, the head of Hamas' media office, says the news report \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".\nMarouf explained that the closure order was issued based on \"multiple pieces of damning evidence which the government supplied the attorney general with demonstrating unprofessional and unethical behaviour on their [the media outlets'] part.\n\"We found out their translation fabricated the original news report ... And they could have visited the Beach Hotel where they claim the Brotherhood officials were staying, and which is a few minutes away from their office, to factually confirm the news before they ran it on their site,\" he added.\nGovernment officials Ghussein and Marouf failed to provide specific complaints about Al Arabiya's coverage, though they vaguely stated that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza were \"offended\" by the Saudi-owned channel's coverage.\nAbd al-Kareem said he found it \"ludicrous\" to justify the closure of Al Arabiya's office by claiming it provides biased anti-Muslim Brotherhood coverage of the ongoing events in Egypt.\n\"We're not biased, and in all cases this is Gaza's office, not Egypt's. If they tried to send a political message by closing our office in Gaza, it would be absolutely ludicrous. And it would be telling that the order has come from a supposedly independent and unaffiliated party, i.e. the attorney general,\" he said.\nHuman rights groups in Gaza have condemned the office closures, saying the decision constituted a violation of press freedoms and freedom of expression, as well as of Palestinian basic law and international human rights standards.\nSamir Zaqout of the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights asserted that \"the closure procedures violate Palestinian Basic Amended Law of 2005, which denies any form of monitoring, ban or warning or the imposition of restrictions over the media unless by a judicial decision in conformity\"."}

{"prompt": "From the outlook of a planet that resides next to a quiet, relatively predictable star, the circumstances that lead to dramatic stellar explosions elsewhere in the universe can sound somewhat improbable. Some such blasts, known as type Ia supernovae, occur when a small, dense star known as a white dwarf\u2014roughly the diameter of Earth, but hundreds of thousands of times more massive\u2014grows too large by siphoning material off a neighboring star, igniting a thermonuclear explosion. Other cataclysms, known as type II supernovae, occur when much heftier stars, some of them dozens of times as massive as the sun, implode under their own weight.\nLuckily those circumstances arise infrequently enough to spare humankind the fallout of a nearby supernova. But the universe is a big place, and locally rare events such as type Ia and type II supernovae happen in relatively large numbers across the vast expanse of space. Now a sky survey has turned up a much rarer kind of supernova, one that defies the standard explanations for how such blasts work.\nF", "baseline": "our new PTF supernovae, along with two events identified in the past several years that defied classification, all share the same unexplained traits: They are extraordinarily bright, and a spectral breakdown of their emitted light shows no trace of common supernova components such as hydrogen, iron and calcium. \"If you look at thousands of supernova spectra, as I do, these immediately jump out to you as being peculiar,\" Quimby says. \"They don't have the normal kinds of wiggles that you'd expect to see.\"\nThe extreme brightness of the new class of supernovae, some 10 times that of a typical type Ia supernova from an exploding white dwarf, rank them among the most luminous supernovae known. That luminosity enabled Quimby and his colleagues to spot a handful of the new supernovae among the 1,000-plus supernovae of all kinds that have been found by PTF, even though core-collapse supernovae appear to be 10,000 times more common.\nBut just what produces the brightness of the new class remains unknown. The way the supernovae fade from their peak brightness over time is inconsistent with the decay of radioactive elements, which is what powers the glow of a type Ia supernova. And in core-collapse cataclysms such as type II supernovae, heavy elements such as iron appear in the spectra, usually accompanied by hydrogen from the expanding supernova blast encountering ambient gas in the circumstellar medium.\nOne possible origin for the superluminous blasts is a very massive star, roughly 100 times the mass of the sun, that ejects a dense shell of hydrogen-depleted material. If it then undergoes core collapse to initiate a supernova, the supernova-driven ejecta would collide with the existing shell to glow brightly. Astronomers have found a precedent of a hydrogen-poor supernova preceded by an eruptive event, says Roger Chevalier, a professor of astronomy at the University of Virginia who did not contribute to the new research. But the scale of that eruption was far too small to explain the luminosity of the PTF group's supernovae.\nAlternately, a supernova could have left behind a magnetar, a highly magnetized form of the dense stellar remnants known as neutron stars. The rapid spin of a magnetar could provide an internal power source to light up the supernova ejecta. But that scenario is wanting for observational backup as well; all known magnetars spin far too slowly to account for the glow of the superluminous blasts. \"You want it to be formed with a spin rate of one to three milliseconds, and we don't have any evidence to show that magnetars form with those kinds of spin rates,\" Chevalier says. \"So in principle at least you can produce the high luminosity in that way, but again there's a lot we don't understand.\"\nQuimby and his colleagues are continuing to look for new events and to track fading supernovae over time to see how they evolve. They have even marshaled the Hubble Space Telescope to gather their ultraviolet spectra. \"By building that whole sequence and incorporating the UV data, we can get a better handle on the physical origins of these things,\" Quimby says. But for the moment neither mechanism for the newfound supernova class is entirely convincing, Chevalier notes. \"They both have their pluses and minuses, and I wouldn't say the community has come to an agreement about what is going on here,\" he says."}

{"prompt": "Performance Reviews Are Pointless And Insulting -- So Why Do They Still Exist?\nI'm the HR Director for a growing manufacturing firm. I started the job in July. I report to the CEO.\nI'm putting my 2018 plan together. One thing I told my boss \"Jake\" when he interviewed me is that I plan to talk him out of the company's annual performance-review process.\nI agree with you that making every employee fill out an evaluation form and sit down to talk about it every year is a huge waste of time and energy, and most employees hate performance reviews.\nIf the relationship is healthy between the manager and the employee, they're having regular conversations anyway \u2014 including quarterly and annual planning sessions. If that isn't happening, I can help managers fix that -- but having more conversations doesn't require an evaluation process.\nI eliminated performance reviews at my last company and everyone was happy about it.\nOf course, employees need to be able to get feedback when they need it. If they can get that feedback without being graded like elementary school students then it's a win-win for everybody.\n", "baseline": "Jake says he might be open to the idea of abolishing performance reviews but he needs a very good reason to do so. In my last company I polled our managers (37 of them) and 35 were in favor of getting rid of performance reviews.\nThe other two managers were neutral. We knew the employees were negative about the performance review process because the subject came up regularly in our Town Hall Meetings and survey responses.\nJake wants me to write up a proposal for him. Thanks in advance for any insights you can share!\nPerformance reviews are artifacts left over from the Industrial Revolution.\nThey come from an earlier time, when work was designed on the mechanical model I call Godzilla.\nIf employees stand in front of a conveyor belt all day polishing widgets, you can easily count the widgets as they come down the line and see which employees are hitting their goals and which folks are missing them.\nKnowledge Work is is more complex and nuanced than that. Knowledge Worker jobs don't boil down to a number of widgets polished per hour or per quarter.\nSomebody on your team might have a breakthrough idea today precisely because they ignored the passing parade of widgets and stared off into space for 45 minutes.\nThat's the energy you want to inspire and capture in your company \u2014 not widget-polishing energy!\nPerformance reviews are not effective at improving performance. They have never shown their value as leadership tools -- but they make excellent power-and-control mechanisms, and that is one reason some companies have trouble giving up on them.\nIt doesn't help an employee move forward for a manager to tell them what they did well and did badly last year. If a manager needs to give someone feedback, they should do that in the moment \u2014 not months later.\nWhen we are lifted up in the service of a larger goal than to hit our weekly and quarterly numbers, we don't need to waste time rating and grading employees. We only need to reinforce them and give them room to run!\nWe need every millisecond of our time and energy to be spent inspiring and encouraging our teammates \u2014 not to mention moving obstacles out of their way.\n1. They take up expensive staff hours for no observable gain. It takes hours and hours of time for employees and managers to complete performance review forms, get them approved, set up performance review meetings and handle the paperwork. The next year, they do it all over again.\nWho benefits from that massive time and energy investment? Do your customers benefit? They don't \u2014 because if there were customer-benefiting information to be shared it would have happened whenever it came to light, not now.\n2. Their purpose is unclear \u2014 and always has been. Various people will tell you that performance reviews are essential for letting employees know how they're doing (why?), to justify pay increases (you don't need performance reviews for that), or to create a paper trail if someone should need to be terminated (doesn't work, because managers almost always give struggling employees average-to-good performance reviews. Later they say \"I was trying to motivate the employee!\").\nAnything you might want to accomplish through performance reviews can be accomplished without them.\n3. They are unfair. Companies come up with rigid systems (five-point review scales and ten-point scales!) but they never solve the biggest rating challenge \u2014 the fact that managers vary dramatically in their assessments of Excellent, Good, Average, Fair and Needs Improvement. Performance reviews are also unfair because they tend to weight more recent events and results more heavily than those from earlier in the year. They are unfair because managers have biases.\n4. Performance reviews are insulting. If I hire someone to work for me doing graphic design, marketing strategy or software development I can talk to them about the project and our relationship. I can let them know if I'm unhappy with something they do or don't do, but it's not my place to tell them how to do their job or how to live their life.\nPerformance reviews cement the bad, old idea that when someone is your supervisor, they sit on a higher plane than you do. That's ridiculous. A supervisor in today's Knowledge Economy is an orchestral conductor. The conductor keeps the orchestra together but doesn't presume to tell the musicians how to play their instruments.\n5. Every business process requires a clear objective and desired outcome, to pay its way in your busy operation. Performance reviews lack both a clear objective and a desired outcome. No one in your company can say \"Here's the outcome we want when we conduct performance reviews next year.\"\nThere is no desired outcome except to remind the employees who's a boss and who isn't \u2014 and to keep up a time-honored tradition simply because you've always done it.\nTalk to your fellow managers and employees and see what they think about performance reviews.\nIf you can't find anybody ready to defend performance reviews, tell Jake \"I didn't hear from anyone who wanted to keep performance reviews going.\n\"This is our opportunity to streamline our company, save money, act on our team members' feedback and shift our culture out of old-fashioned command and control management into new-millennium leadership!\"\nMost managers, like most employees, fear change.\nCEOs fear change, too. Tell Jake you'll use 2018 as a test year to see if your organization falls apart when you put the kibosh on performance reviews. I predict that like every other company that has done away with them, you'll be much happier when they're gone!"}
{"prompt": "Changed my mind. Let me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created. But I will never understand what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain. Reboots fair better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original. Reboots also do better when they listen to a still passionate fan base which is what it's all about, isn't it? That's why we do reboots. The fans are why we all get to do what we do. So we wish them well and hope for success.\nThe Charmed star's comment on Twitter regarding what is \"fierce, funny or feminist\" is likely a reference to the reboot's description, which used those adjectives when describing itself. It is one of the things Holly Marie Combs has spoken out on social media about before. In late January, she addressed it in a tweet referencing the new series \"feminist storyline.\"", "baseline": "Many fans believe the original series also shared that characteristic.\nWhy The CW did not want to follows other networks and launch a revival of the original Charmed is anyone's guess. Fans of the original were clearly very open to the idea of continuing the story of \"the charmed ones.\" Charmed has accrued a passionate fan base in the twenty years since it premiered. The original series premiered in 1998 and ran for eight seasons before concluding in 2006. As of 2018, the series has been off the air for twelve years.\nThrough reruns and the entire series streaming on Netflix, it has been able to reach an even wider audience through the years. While television has been in the habit of bringing shows from the past back to life with a new cast and a similar storyline, it has also found tremendous success with ones that bring the original cast back for a new story. NBC and ABC have both experienced success using the latter formula for sitcoms and a drama should theoretically experience similar results.\nThe CW could have brought Charmed back and then done the reboot as a spinoff, maintaining both shows and expanding the franchise. The network gave the go-ahead for the reboot in January and this May, The CW picked up the series. The Charmed reboot will air after Supergirl on Sundays, as part of The CW's newly launched lineup for the night. The first trailer for the series has already been released, which led to a passionate response from fans. An exact premiere date for the reboot has not been announced yet.\nThe Charmed reboot will air Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on The CW, this fall.

{"prompt": "You might want to start brushing up on your Iranian rap. Or Palestinian trance. Jordanian Punk will be important too. And don't forget Bahraini R&B. This is the music of the new revolution sweeping the Middle East. In Tahrir Square Egyptians rocked to a catchy number by rocker Mohammad Munir, who asked, \"How can I love you [Egypt] if you don't give that love back?\" If you want to know what the anthem of change in Yemen will be, check out mideastunes.com, where the region's revolutionary playlist is ready for download. This is no sugarcoated pop site. The music is about social change, human rights and freedom of expression, and it's manned (rather, womanned) by Esra'a Al Shafei, 24, a Bahraini activist whose social consciousness was raised not by western rock, but by the passioned rhymes of Kurdish Hip-Hop. \"My inspiration comes from music,\" says Shafei, who cut her activist teeth campaigning for the rights of Kur", "baseline": "ds at the age of 18. \"Sure, people like Gandhi give me hope, but what makes me want to go out and make change is people's stories, and that comes through their music.\"\nBut Mideasttunes is only a small part of Shafei's campaign for change. She also founded mideastyouth.com, a multi-media web platform that uses tweets, blogs, stories, links, videos and discussion forums to promote tolerance, human rights, freedom of speech and democracy not just in her native Bahrain, but around the Middle East. The site focuses on campaigns for the rights of migrant workers, persecuted religious groups, Kurds, and other minority issues. \"These are issues that are not limited to one country, they affect all of us in the Middle East,\" she says, in rapid-fire English. \"I wanted to use the pan-Arab movement to build relations between activists throughout the region.\"\nIt's working. The site has become the go-to place for young Arab activists. It's where people get ideas, and learn about new issues. And, most important, it's where they go for support. As a Bahraini, Shafei has to be cautious about pushing for change in her own country. At least two protesters were killed in an uprising that brought thousands to the capital's central square on Sunday and Tuesday. She has a family to protect, and, as she points out, \"If something happens to me, what happens to my work?\" Instead she helps activists in other countries, who in turn help her. It's like an online activism co-op. As an example, she is helping activists push for Kurdish rights in Syria, something she couldn't do if she were actually in Syria. \"It's a way for us to help each other out,\" she says. \"I tell people to practice caution if you live in those [repressive] countries, and focus on social rights activism elsewhere. It's a way to come together over the things we have in common \u0097 a desire for rights and freedoms.\"\nMideastyouth is about forging connections. It's also about producing content that raises awareness. The site produces cartoons and comics for distribution. A cartoon about the abuse of domestic workers, for example, or an engaging ad for Kurdish rights. The messages are clear, the production values high and the medium engaging. The result, she hopes, is getting people to think, and act. One promotional spot, a jazzy ad done in the style of a tourism commercial about the persecution of the Baha'i' minority in Egypt got thousands of hits within the first few days. \"People were talking about it because Muslims were doing it. Even the Baha'is were surprised,\" says Shafei, explaining that it was the first time a Muslim organization had been formed to fight specifically for Baha'i rights. To her, generating buzz is almost as important as getting the message across. \"This is what we do to get traditional media to talk about these issues,\" she says. \"And that is how you get the attention we really want.\" Of course the Internet is huge in the Middle East, she says. But your average Saudi isn't going to Google human rights. \"We can't wait for them to come to us. So we create new ways to find them.\" Once they connect, \"we can find more people wanting to work with the cause.\"\nShafei focuses on minority rights, she says, \"because we cannot have human rights for ourselves if the minorities in our countries don't either.\" Many rights-based organizations in the Middle East have traditionally been self-centered \u0097 for example, women supporting women. That kind of silo mentality is ultimately destructive, says Shafei. It keeps organizations isolated, and it also enables authoritarian regimes to play one group against another. \"As a Bahraini woman, yes, I would like my rights,\" she says. \"But in comparison to religious minorities or migrant workers, I have a lot more rights. I'm Muslim, Arab, a member of the mainstream that has more freedom of speech and a more comfortable life. We can't progress as a society if we leave the most vulnerable behind.\"\nThe hard work of overthrowing dictators, of course, is better left to locals. \"There are plenty of groups working on regime change, so we focus on the people who don't have a voice.\" That doesn't mean that she turns her back on calls for change \u0097 she pumps up the volume. She just launched crowdvoice.org, a user-powered service that tracks voices of protest from around the world through crowdsourcing. \"People can use it to collect or view collections of videos, photos, news stories, blogs, tweets and other media sources on current events,\" she says. \"It's used to amplify voices of dissent.\"\nShafei makes it very clear that her push for democracy and human rights has nothing to do with an American agenda for the Middle East. If anything, she says, the U.S. has demonstrated that its principal value in the region, at least, is self-interest. \"The United States continues to support repressive and anti-democratic regimes. The U.S. Government was aware of the injustices in Egypt, but continued supporting Mubarak because of self-interest. No one can argue that Saudi Arabia is the home of human rights or democracy, yet America continues to support the regime.\"\nThe credibility of the U.S. among the young in the Middle East, Shafei says, \"is in negative numbers.\" She says that neither she, nor other members of the Arab youth movement, are against Americans. When you see Arabs burning the flag, \"It's not Anti-American, it's anti-American foreign policy hypocrisy.\""}

Instead, workers built two walls and installed the toilet pot, then dug a trench to lay piping towards the sewage point at the outside toilet \u2014 and left.\nThe piping was never connected, the trenches were left open and the toilet doors were never installed, rendering the lavatories useless.\n\u201cI had to fill up this deep hole they just left in the back yard because it\u2019s dangerous for the old people and kids,\u201d beneficiary Alfred Louw explains outside his two-bedroom council house in Rusdene, opposite the Beaufort West football stadium.\n\u201cThey would start building a little bit here, then go next door to build a little bit, then come back and continue. Then in January, they left it like this. But if there\u2019s just a hole in the fence of the stadium, it gets fixed now-now,\u201d Louw says.\nConstable says the council budgeted R8-million for the project and intended to build 80 toilets costing about R30 000 each. The high cost is owed to a \u201clabour-intensive approach\u201d.\n\u201cWe said we could give the project to a big contractor to bring in machines and do it quickly, but our intention was to create jobs. So when you create jobs, you have to go with the labour-intensive approach. That\u2019s why we are still waiting for the rest of the R8-million and that project will be completed,\u201d he said.\nThen there\u2019s the municipal accounts. When Van der Linde was ousted, he is said to have left the municipality with R2-million in its current account. In the five months since Prince and Constable have been in charge, the account has sunk into a R7-million overdraft, and Eskom and South African Revenue Service bills have not been settled.\n\u201cThe reason we are sitting with this problem \u2026 You see, Japie is a bit confused \u2026 He continued with a tender without having a letter of assurance from national treasury that they can roll over the money, and that put us in a very awkward financial position,\u201d Prince says.\nOther residents, however, are not fooled by Prince\u2019s charms. The town\u2019s informal settlements have doubled in size over the past 10 years, residents say, and Prince has done very little to alleviate their suffering.\nThe N1 highway cuts through the town\u2019s business district, bypassing B&Bs, colonial-era churches and the popular Chris Barnard Museum, and is usually packed with trucks and taxis making their final stopover before heading to Cape Town.\nIn Mandlenkosi, the worn-out streets are littered with rubbish and turn into dusty gravel roads passing by the asbestos council houses, where children compete with cattle and goat herders for space on the open fields to play football. Unemployed men and women sit in their front yards while others loiter in front of spaza shops owned by foreign nationals.\nBeaufort West has an unemployment rate of more than 60%, according to the latest figures from Statistics South Africa (2017). Many believe Prince has failed to deliver on his promises to bring about change.\n\u201cWe need to put food on the table and get jobs \u2014 we are not here to take pictures!\u201d a young man in a KDF T-shirt exclaims angrily as Constable emerges from his office.\nHe is part of a large group of people who came to the office to inquire about when the toilet project, on which they earned R2\u2009200 a month as temporary workers, would resume.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, he is just a politician. If you\u2019re not his supporter, he won\u2019t help you. And most people here don\u2019t like to kiss people\u2019s asses. We are really struggling,\u201d says resident Angie Stuurman, who hopes to get her first job in two years.\nPrince supporters call him \u201cBeaufort se baas\u201d \u2014 someone who can tend to their immediate needs, usually by channelling government money into football projects.\n\u201cI\u2019m a soccer lover and I started football in the area ... If our sports structures are functional, then it will get the youngsters away from crime and drugs,\u201d Prince says.\nPrince is not shy about Beaufort West\u2019s heavy investment in football. The Fifa stadium cost R30\u2011million to build \u2014 R6.3-million was spent on astroturf alone \u2014 and this was money well spent, according to him. A former local football star, Prince now owns and partially manages the Beaufort West City football club.\nBut if Van der Linde and his DA colleagues have their way, Prince\u2019s return to the deputy mayorship will be short-lived. Among the strategies being considered to remove him from office is a case opened against Prince for allegedly stealing water from the drought-stricken town.\nAfter his interview with the M&G, there\u2019s a large group of people still waiting outside to see him. Prince speeds past them on his way to the mayoral committee meeting, infuriating them even more."}

He was 58.\nThe news swept the capital like a shock wave, with colleagues, rivals, President Bush and those vying to succeed him remembering Russert as a superb practitioner of political analysis and an irrepressible son of blue-collar Buffalo who, quite simply, loved the game.

Grounded in prodigious research, Russert would press his guests on past statements and contradictions, often for a full hour, spawning legions of imitators.\nFriends were stunned by the news. \"I just loved him,\" said Bob Schieffer, host of CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"When I scooped old Tim, I felt like I'd hit a home run off the best pitcher in the league.\"\n\"He was made for Washington because he lived and breathed politics,\" said Judy Woodruff, a former NBC correspondent now with PBS. \"When our son was sick about 10 years ago, he was right there, calling, coming over, bringing him back gifts from trips.\"\nRussert's internist, Michael A. Newman, told MSNBC that an autopsy showed the journalist had an enlarged heart and that cholesterol plaque ruptured an artery, causing coronary thrombosis. He said Russert had been diagnosed earlier with coronary artery disease, but that it was controlled with medication and exercise and Russert had performed well on a stress test in late April.\nThe thread of Russert's career is laced through recent political history. His whiteboard from Election Night 2000 -- on which, early in the evening, he scribbled \"Florida, Florida, Florida\" -- became an iconic symbol of the disputed tally. Days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Vice President Cheney chose to appear on \"Meet the Press.\" In late 2006, Sen. Obama used the Russert program to say he was considering a White House run.\nRussert moved his father, a former sanitation worker, to a nursing facility last week and had escaped for a brief vacation in Italy with his wife, Vanity Fair writer Maureen Orth, and their son, Luke, before returning to Washington Thursday. Luke Russert, a radio sports commentator, had just graduated from college.\nFormer anchor Tom Brokaw gave MSNBC viewers the news at 3:40 p.m. \"He worked to the point of exhaustion so many weeks,\" Brokaw said, adding: \"This news division will not be the same without his strong, clear voice.\"\nWithin minutes, all the cable networks were airing nonstop remembrances of Russert, as if a head of state had died, and tributes poured in. Bush called him \"an institution,\" \"tough and hardworking,\" and \"as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it.\"\nObama told reporters he considered Russert \"not only a journalist but a friend.

Get It?\nKimberly Guilfoyle and Andrea Tantaros will host a new show on Fox News, in which they and two other women will gang up on one man.\nRoger Ailes is an evil genius. In the midst of a nationwide debate over whether Republicans are waging a war on women, Fox News is launching a new show called Outnumbered at the end of April. Outnumbered because the show will feature four female and one male host. The man will be \u201coutnumbered,\u201d meaning that even though Outnumbered is supposedly a female-centric show, the male point of view is still so central that it gives the show its title.\nReally, the word outnumbered should apply to the rest of Fox\u2019s programming, where only 36 percent of anchors and correspondents are women.

Gender imbalance is only noteworthy when women outnumber men.\nStill, you have to hand it to Ailes for mastering the art of having it both ways.

Mediaite reports that the show will feature Kimberly Guilfoyle and Andrea Tantaros, two women who have built careers out of reassuring cranky old misogynists that there are hot young women out there who agree with them.* On the other hand, the very setup of the show inoculates it against this accusation, since hey, Fox is giving women jobs on TV. It\u2019s the same trick Republicans pull by putting female faces out front when pushing abortion restrictions or undermining equal-pay efforts.\nSo, will I tune in for Outnumbered? Absolutely, if only to see how the set designers create a desk that can show off four pairs of legs at once. Maybe, once given a show of their own, the second-tier ladies of Fox will start throwing their weight around like Megyn Kelly does. Kelly, who actually kicked Sean Hannity out of his time slot, has enough power to occasionally push back a little against the overwhelming tide of sexism spewing forth from her network. Then again, Kelly has a unique presence on the network, and she knows it, whereas many of the other women likely understand that someone else open to wearing 6-inch heels and shellacking on the makeup can probably replace them.

The Greater Farmington Chamber of Commerce, which runs the festival, held children\u2019s events and Fido Fest dog activities at Shiawassee Park last year, while maintaining musical entertainment and a beer tent in the parking lot at the Downtown Farmington Center on Grand River Avenue and Farmington Road. Art and crafts vendor booths were stationed on Farmington Road, south of State Street.\nNext year all but the parade on Grand River will be held in the park. A section of Shiawassee Road from Power to Farmington Road will be closed.\nFarmington City Council unanimously approved the Chamber\u2019s special event application earlier this month.\nMary Martin, Chamber president, said the park is \u201clogistically good\u201d for a full festival, including entertainment and a beer tent. She told city officials that the children\u2019s activities and canine events were successful last year and that sponsors were interested in concentrating all activities at one site, strengthening the festival\u2019s exposure. She also noted that public safety costs would decrease with all activities in one place and parking would be freed up in the downtown shopping center. Farmington Road downtown also would remain open.\n\u201cCertainly, the beer tent is a draw in the evening, but in the day people are looking for entertainment. People are looking for things to do, not necessarily to buy things,\u201d she said, during a recent phone interview.\nAt Joe\u2019s Headquarters on Farmington Road north of State Street, hairstylist Brandy Gregg voiced her support for moving the festival to Shiawassee Park. She said some of her clients cancelled appointments during the event when it was held downtown because they couldn\u2019t find parking in the area.\nJoe and Kendra Mantey, owners of The Cheese Lady, located on the east side of the Downtown Farmington Center, said the festival neither helped nor hurt their business.\n\u201cOne the one hand you hopefully have some new people come in and that theoretically leads to more business later.

He wrote that holding the festival in Shiawassee Park would cost downtown businesses revenue and over time would downgrade the event.\n\u201cMy biggest objection is restaurants are going to pay the price for the moving of the beer tent to the park. They\u2019ll fill the place with food trucks. All that revenue going to food trucks. That is not economic development,\" he said.\nHe accused the city council and Downtown Development Authority of abdicating their responsibility by allowing the Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with an events production company, to produce the festival.\nAccording to DDA Director Kate Knight, a nonprofit organization ran the festival before the DDA took it on in 2009, handing management to the Chamber in 2014.

Traffic can be suffocating. Affordable housing, even if better than Boston, is not as widely available as is needed.\n\"In MetroWest, we are clearly open to embracing and managing change, but our greatest challenge will be continuing to manage the growth,\" Spilka said. \"We must be really careful to continue to carefully steward our growth.\"\nShe outlined several priorities she hopes to see taken up in the Legislature to improve quality of life in MetroWest and elsewhere. Lawmakers need to find consensus on addressing climate change, lowering prescription drug costs, and improving mental health services, she said.\nThe Senate President voiced hope that this session would finally see education reforms enacted, almost four years after the Foundation Budget Review Commission outlined crucial gaps in the existing formula that leave schools underfunded by as much as $1 billion. She also echoed House Speaker Robert DeLeo's interest in considering various options to raise new transportation revenues.\n\"We know what the problems are. We know roughly what the price tag is.

Every incumbent was re-elected to another two-year term, including some, like Rogers and Ed Whitfield, R-Hopkinsville, who have spent decades in Washington.\nFew vigorous House races are expected anytime soon. For one thing, the two-party system has eroded. Faced with Kentucky\u2019s status as a deeply conservative red state, Democrats essentially have surrendered the congressional delegation, said Tres Watson, spokesman for the Kentucky Republican Party.\nThe focus of the Kentucky Democratic Party on Nov. 8 will be preserving the narrow Democratic majority in the state House of Representatives, a crucial check on the power of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, said party spokesman Daniel Lowry. It\u2019s not clear what help, if any, the party will be able to offer its congressional candidates who face an uphill climb, Lowry said.\nHowever, in 2014, the Kentucky Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington did not provide much assistance to Elisabeth Jensen, the Democrat challenging Barr that year. Barr outspent Jensen by $3-to-$1 and beat her by 20 points.\nOnce they are entrenched in Washington, congressmen enjoy a huge fundraising advantage that discourages most people from challenging them. Wealthy donors with an interest in favorable legislation and government spending line up to write them checks \u201cbecause they\u2019re a sure thing and a known quantity,\u201d Dugi said.\nFor example, Barr, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, collects hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks, payday lenders, investment firms and other businesses affected by his work. Roughly two-thirds of Barr\u2019s campaign money so far this election cycle comes from outside Kentucky, including more than $600,000 from lobbyist-rich Washington and its suburbs.\nRogers, first elected in 1980, enjoys even greater fundraising clout as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which decides how the government spends its money. Rogers\u2019 campaigns have raised nearly $11 million over the last 25 years, although he seldom faces much opposition in his Southeastern Kentucky district.\nVoters choose the names they recognize and feel good about, Dugi said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got someone like Hal Rogers, who has been there forever and who has brought so much pork back home \u2026 the chances of anyone coming in and beating him are slim to none.

Here's a quick recap of the 2011 Emmys hits, misses and WTFs.\nShe was great. From her bit in the opening number when she discovered the joys of laugh tracks to her \"gay agenda\"\u2014involving calling Rachel Maddow and changing her oil--to her skit as Donatella the Jersey housewife behind \"The Jersey Shore\" and 113 other TV shows, Lynch's jokes were tight and her timing was on point.

Not her fault, but someone", "baseline": "should've said something.\nBaldwin had a joke about the News Corp phone hacking scandal cut from his opening bit. Baldwin asked that the bit be cut, allegedly not over it being censored, but because he felt the bit didn\u2019t flow without the line. So Fox reshot the bit with Leonard Nimoy in his stead. With the knowledge that the bit had been edited and then lost Baldwin, there was no hope that it would work, and it didn't\u2014fortunately, it was short and merely an intro to Lynch's opening number. It turned out to be a classic case of not being able to enjoy the sausage once you knew how it was made\u2014kinda wish Baldwin hadn\u2019t given a play-by-lay via Twitter.\nIn a year when women seemed to have made a great leap forward in the world of comedy, with films like \"Bad Teacher\" and \"Bridesmaids\" letting the ladyfolk take the lead, to see Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Edie Falco, Laura Linney, Martha Plimpton and eventual winner Melissa McCarthy brought up on stage for a faux beauty pageant was gross, and made grosser still when McCarthy was handed a tiara and a bouquet of roses. Watching it, we were hoping against hope that it was a set-up for making the men go through the same shtick, but alas\u2026 And then there was a bizarre echo to the moment when McCarthy and Poehler came out to present Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie, making jokes about how men had to show a little skin to keep audiences interested.\nThroughout the evening the action was thrown to a chorus comprised of Joel McHale, Wilmer Valderama, Zach Levi, Cobie Smulders, Tajari P. Henson and Kate Flannery singing introductions to different segments of the show. It was forced, incomprehensible and pointless, serving only to slow down the action. The highlight from the chorus was Zach picking his nose and trying to wipe it on Wilmer's coat, or maybe LL Cool J's cameo.\nA mini-episode of the acclaimed show featured guest stars like Kim Kardashian (\"'Work'? Am I pronouncing that right?\") and \"Breaking Bad\" star Aaron Paul as Creed's meth dealer was hilarious and topped of with the perfect ending, as Ed Helms went in to confront the new boss, Ashton Kutcher, suggesting that maybe he was in the wrong place. It was our first look at the newly minted \"Two and a Half Men\" star in action, and he nailed it.\nThe rap trio Lonely Island (\"Saturday Night Live's\" Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone, and Andy Samberg) sort of popped up out of nowhere, with Michael Bolton, Akon, Maya Rudolph and Bill Macy in tow. We're not sure what they were doing there, but they crushed it.\nThe will-he/won\u2019t-he drama surrounding Sheen's rumored appearance made for some good gossip, but when the moment finally came, he was almost disappointingly gracious, wishing his former \"Two and a Half Men\" colleagues the best of luck. It was a bit of a letdown after all the shenanigans Sheen has perpetrated this past year, but it was the right thing to do.\nWhy were the comedy awards handed out, and then the reality and variety awards followed by the drama prizes? Awards bodies have dissed comedy forever, why implicitly enforce the impression that they're something lesser? Especially on a night when a sitcom, \"Modern Family,\" won more awards than any other show. And any time you structure a show that invites viewers to tune out for 10, 20 or 30 minutes, you've done something wrong.\nAny awards show that ends a minute early automatically scores at least a 6, and this show was decidedly stronger than that even."}

The government that is in place is the one that I prefer. They have managed to put more money into the educational system and into the healthcare system, both of which I care about deeply.

It\u2019s not just a way of keeping kids off the street until they are old enough to find a job. The better the education system works, the better our economy will work because the people going into the economy as employees, employers, business people will have a better understanding of how to make life better for themselves and their families without making other peoples\u2019 families suffer.\nI don\u2019t believe this has anything to do with any political agenda \u2013 in my opinion.

{"prompt": "The US has to stand up to China's abusive trade practices like intellectual property theft. And we won't leave farmers to face Chinese bullying alone.\nIn 2011, a group of Chinese nationals dug up genetically engineered seeds from an Iowa corn field and planned to steal and send them back to China, so they could be reverse engineered. Those seeds, the result of years of research and millions of dollars of American investment, now stand as one of countless pieces of evidence in the case against China for intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\nNow, President Donald Trump is standing up to China, which wrongly believes it can bully our farmers to get America to back away from defending our national interests. The president understands that our farmers feed, fuel and clothe this nation and the world, and he will not allow U.S. agriculture to bear the brunt of China\u2019s retaliatory tactics.\nAmerican producers have benefited from the policies of the Trump administration, including historic tax reforms and reduced regulations. And farmers know that 20 cents of every dollar of their income", "baseline": "relies on trade, which is why they are watching the situation with China closely. The simple truth is that when trading partners break the rules, there must be consequences.\nTo stop China\u2019s predatory attacks on America\u2019s innovation base, President Trump is instituting a program of tariffs and is considering investment restrictions and strengthened export controls. These tariffs will help pressure the Chinese to stop engaging in unfair practices and fully open up its markets to U.S. products, including U.S. technologies. The correct response from China would be to stop stealing from Americans and give American products a level playing field to compete in China, not to retaliate and reinforce its own position.\nMore: Donald Trump promised a trade war. Should we let his voters get what they asked for?\nThere is no denying that the disruption in trade relations with China is unsettling to many in agriculture, but if the president succeeds in changing China\u2019s behavior, America\u2019s farmers will reap the benefits.\nIn the meantime, the president has instructed me to craft a strategy to support our farmers in the face of retaliatory tariffs. At the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we have tools at our disposal to support farmers faced with losses that might occur due to downturns in commodities markets. To this point, we have not unveiled our strategy, as it is not good practice to open our playbook while the opposing team is watching.\nBut farmers should know this: They have stood with President Trump and his policies, and we will make good on our promise to stand with them as well. If China does not soon mend its ways, we will quickly begin fulfilling our promise to support producers, who have become casualties of these disputes.\nWithout question, there is much at stake for this nation in trade disagreements. A bullying and predatory China has made no secret of the fact that it seeks to acquire America\u2019s technological crown jewels by any means necessary \u2014 through physical and cybertheft, forced technology transfer, evasion of our export controls, and state-directed and -funded investment in sensitive technology. And while it may seem outrageous, China has rejected American genetically engineered products, while sending agents crawling in corn fields to pilfer samples of our technology and even purchasing a company that provides U.S. farmers with key genetically engineered seeds.\nPresident Trump has said correctly that if China captures the industries of tomorrow, America will not have an economic future to look forward to \u2014 and our national security will be severely compromised. Cutting-edge technologies \u2014 from artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and biotechnology to aerospace, high-tech shipping and robotics \u2014 are critical to our defense. We are faced with a decision: Will others determine our destiny, or will we control our own future?\nChina began raiding our economy long before a team of thieves infiltrated that Iowa corn field, but President Trump aims to stop the larceny now. The president is a tough negotiator, and I am confident that American agriculture will flourish because of trade relationships that are smarter, stronger and better than before. China might underestimate the strength and resolve of American farmers, but the president does not. And he will not allow our agricultural producers to suffer because of China\u2019s continued bad actions."}

The first of its kind, this device is inexpensive, small, thin and flexible like a sheet of plastic.\nThe researchers call it a snow-based triboelectric nanogenerator, or snow TENG. A triboelectric nanogenerator, which generates charge through static electricity, produces energy from the exchange of electrons.\nFindings about the device are published in the journal Nano Energy.\nSnow is positively charged and gives up electrons. Silicone \u2014 a synthetic rubber-like material that is composed of silicon atoms and oxygen atoms, combined with carbon, hydrogen and other elements \u2014 is negatively charged. When falling snow contacts the surface of silicone, that produces a charge that the device captures, creating electricity.\n\u201cSnow is already charged, so we thought, why not bring another material with the opposite charge and extract the charge to create electricity?\u201d said co-author Maher El-Kady, a UCLA assistant researcher of chemistry and biochemistry.\nAbout 30 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface is", "baseline": "covered by snow each winter, during which time solar panels often fail to operate, El-Kady noted. The accumulation of snow reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar array, limiting the panels\u2019 power output and rendering them less effective. The new device could be integrated into solar panels to provide a continuous power supply when it snows, he said.\nThe device can be used for monitoring winter sports, such as skiing, to more precisely assess and improve an athlete\u2019s performance when running, walking or jumping, Kaner said. It also has the potential for identifying the main movement patterns used in cross-country skiing, which cannot be detected with a smart watch.\nIt could usher in a new generation of self-powered wearable devices for tracking athletes and their performances.\nIt can also send signals, indicating whether a person is moving. It can tell when a person is walking, running, jumping or marching.\nThe research team used 3-D printing to design the device, which has a layer of silicone and an electrode to capture the charge. The team believes the device could be produced at low cost given \u201cthe ease of fabrication and the availability of silicone,\u201d Kaner said. Silicone is widely used in industry, in products such as lubricants, electrical wire insulation and biomedical implants, and it now has the potential for energy harvesting.\nCo-authors include Abdelsalam Ahmed, who conducted the research while completing his doctoral studies at the University of Toronto; Islam Hassan and Ravi Selvaganapathy of Canada\u2019s McMaster University; and James Rusling of the University of Connecticut and his research team.\nKaner\u2019s research was funded by Nanotech Energy, a company spun off from his research (Kaner is chair of its scientific advisory board and El-Kady is chief technology officer); and Kaner\u2019s Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation.\nKaner\u2019s laboratory has produced numerous devices, including a membrane that separates oil from water and cleans up the debris left by oil fracking. Fracking is a technique to extract gas and oil from shale rock.\nKaner, El-Kady and colleagues designed a device in 2017 that can use solar energy to inexpensively and efficiently create and store energy, which could be used to power electronic devices and to create hydrogen fuel for eco-friendly cars. This year, they published research on their design of the first fire-retardant, self-extinguishing motion sensor and power generator, which could be embedded in shoes or clothing worn by firefighters and others who work in harsh environments.\nKaner is among the world\u2019s most influential and highly cited scientific researchers.

Awards went to the likes of Riz Ahmed, who won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series, making him the first South Asian man in Emmy's 69-year history to win for acting. Or Lena Waithe, who is the first African American woman to win for comedic writing.\nThere was one message, though, that was quietly making a statement without saying a word.\nTwo Hollywood stars who were also winners last night, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley, were both spotted wearing Duet Pink Rings by the company dedicated to creating a \"supportive, powerful network for the women in its tribe,\" Shiffon Co.\nA close-up of the Duet Pinky Ring on Actress, Shailene Woodley, at the 69th Annual Emmy Awards.\nThe adjustable pinky ring that coils around the finger and ends with two stones (a sapphire and diamond, or diamond and diam", "baseline": "ond) represents a pinky promise, referencing the unbreakable pact you made when you were kids. The idea behind the Duet Pinky Ring is that it serves as a physical reminder to promise to pay it forward to other women. The side-by-side stones were even designed to represent one woman supporting one another.\n\"We wanted to build an innovative and empowered brand for women since so many of the top household names were founded by men,\" says the jewelry company's founder, Shilpa Yarlagadda.\nShiffon Co., a collective of eight women who are still undergrads at top universities like Harvard and Stanford, are donating 50% of the sales of the rings to seed grants for start-ups around the world whose mission it is to support, uplift, educate or promote the well-being, safety, health and general advancement of women and girls.\nThese driven group of students were able to get the rings onto the hands of these A-listers simply through the potency of the company mission--they did not use PR or pay the actors to wear them. Instead, the women behind Shiffon Co. got through to Kidman and Woodley and pitched the ring. The two actors then decided the cause was one they wanted to support and wore the pinky ring to the Emmys in solidarity with the company mission. Before them, Emma Watson donned the ring and gave it a shout out on her Instagram account dedicated to her fashion, the_press_tour.\nLike Kidman and Watson, Hitha Herzog, Chief Research Officer of H Squared Research, was one of those people on the other end of a cold call from the team at Shiffon Co. Herzog, too, was so moved by their mission, she joined their Board of Directors. \"Shilpa's email to me was short but thought-provoking, she didn't add extra words or bury the lede,\" Herzog says. \"Then I met with her and was blown away. When asked, Shilpa answered all of my questions in a way that displayed she had a good grasp on how retail works. Most importantly, she was a genuinely kind person.\"\nSimilarly, celebrity stylist, Sarah Slutsky, also received a call from the founders, which led to her becoming one of the company's closest mentors. \"I get a lot emails from people who are looking to start a business or get into fashion, but something about their energy right off the bat felt really different. There was a need to give back and to do something bigger than them,\" says Slutsky. \"And as a stylist, jewelry is very important to me and what I do. It's very personal and representative, so it's nice to be able to present something to clients that has such meaning.\"\nWith the company motto, \"wear the change you want to see,\" these young founders aspire to bring the best in humanity by working to create a world where young girls grow up knowing they can follow their passions with the support of a worldwide network of strong women.\n\"We want people to stand up for what they believe in by supporting other women,\" adds Yarlagadda. \"It's crazy, but I think we can create a more connected and supported world for women through making beautiful jewelry.\""}

{"prompt": "I\u2019ve always had an interest in colour. Coming from Scotland, where the weather often turns everything grey, I used to love how the landscape would transform when the sun came out. I had a view of the Ochil hills from my bedroom window which became an ever-changing kaleidoscope of colours through the seasons.\nIt was this blend of colours in nature that gave me my first introduction into colour harmony. In the world around us colours juxtapose with one another all the time, but the very fact that they do means it\u2019s often easy to take the striking harmonies they produce for granted. Think about an inky grey sky against a wet green hill, or a bright orange beak against a blackbird\u2019s feathers. Even the bright red poppy, which brightens yellow and green fields around the country, is made redder and more distinctive by the green stem and leaves which support it. Of course, there\u2019s no real need to understand how colour works (unless, like me, you have to!). But just as learning the musical structure of a favourite song or finding out the backstory of a favourite novel enhances our appreciation for those works, so", "baseline": "too can understanding colour harmonies enhance how we see.\nColour therefore plays a crucial role in our lives. It can remind us of a place, a smell, a time of year, a person; our memories and cultures are filled with colour associations. They can even have different meanings from one culture to another. For example, in Japanese culture, yellow represents bravery and wealth, whilst in France the same colour represents jealousy and betrayal. In many cultures, blue represents masculinity, whereas it is considered a feminine colour in China. And red \u2013 the colour of danger, passion, love and fear in countless western cultures \u2013 is actually symbolic of mourning in South Africa.\nAbove all, colour is something that we can have an instinctive and long-lasting personal reaction to. We either like or don\u2019t like certain colours and we don\u2019t need words to explain why, because our emotive response to colours were there well before language developed \u2013 before we gave them names. My favourite colour is blue \u2013 which may well be most people\u2019s favourite colour \u2013 and I can\u2019t imagine it ever becoming boring for me. There are so many beautiful blues in art. I love Matisse\u2019s blue cut-out nudes, for which he used gouache straight from the tube, painted it onto sheets of paper and then \u201ccut\u201d directly into colour. The French artist Yves Klein fell so in love with blue that not only did he make it the star of both his paintings and performances, he also patented his own shade: Yves Klein Blue.\nThis book is a celebration of colour. I hope people will find inspiration in the illustrations and learn a few things they didn\u2019t know. Most importantly, I hope it encourages people to have a bolder relationship with the colours in the world around them."}
{"prompt": "When Rick Gates turned against his former boss, he described a parallel ethical universe where lying and cheating were as comfortable as a well-tailored ostrich suit.\nYou know what would be surprising? If Rick Gates and Paul Manafort had suddenly suspended their apparently deeply ingrained habits of fraudulence and thievery during the three months they ran the Donald Trump campaign.\nOther chapters of their recent history\u2014the chapters bracketing the campaign\u2014include alleged episodes of witness tampering, lying to federal prosecutors, bank and tax fraud, as well as the failure to register as agents of a foreign government. Therefore, given all that has emerged about their shared ethical framework, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the public has received the exhaustive account of those months.\nTo understand just how ingrained their slippery habits had become, consider a defining moment from Monday\u2019s proceedings of the Manafort trial. In the course of turning state\u2019s witness against his old boss, Gates, a former lobbyist, admitted to the court that he had repeatedly defrauded Manafort by inflating the expense reports he", "baseline": "submitted to him. It wasn\u2019t a trivial sum that he had siphoned. He described his take as amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or put it this way: Gates defrauded Manafort, who was, in turn, allegedly defrauding banks and the United States government (with his Potemkin tax returns).\nNor was there anything necessarily spiteful about Gates filching a little cash on the sly. Based on everything I\u2019ve ever heard or read in the course of my reporting on Manafort, Gates worshipped his boss. He felt a sense of subservience, love even. And the warmth was mutual, and could be described as filial. But that bond was never going to get in the way of bilking Manafort. They had spent nearly a decade in Ukraine, working for oligarchs and politicians. During those years abroad, the pair adopted the business practices of the Ukrainian political elite.\nThe president would then ask his chief of staff to collect contributions from the financial patrons of his political party. One Manafort associate told me that in the course of passing the hat to oligarchs, the chief of staff would collect more money than the bill required. The chief of staff would pocket some of that surplus cash for himself, a small tax for his efforts. In Ukraine, the rich excel at finding novel ways to exact fees, to skim money, to capture rents. Having participated in the system for so long, it seems Manafort and Gates internalized these techniques themselves.\nSo what? One strand of conventional wisdom holds that the Manafort trial has little to do with Trump, let alone Russian collusion. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to be made that this case stands on its own as a significant moment in political history. But we\u2019re still staring at a highly incomplete version of the full narrative\u2014and it\u2019s too soon to foreclose the possibility that this trial is merely prologue, filled with foreshadowing and suggestive hints of how everything might ultimately tie together.\nLast week, I argued that Manafort needs to be understood as a symptom of a global epidemic of kleptocracy\u2014a virus that he imported into the United States. We know that his tenure in the Trump campaign contains at least some evidence that he infected the campaign, too. According to Robert Mueller\u2019s prosecutors, Manafort promised a job on the campaign to a Chicago banker in exchange for $16 million in loans. The banker ended up as one of the Trump campaign\u2019s 13 official economic advisors. Could it be possible that that\u2019s the only instance of Manafort and Gates applying their Ukrainian education to the Trump campaign?\nWith Gates\u2019s testimony, Mueller has orchestrated an important demonstration project. He\u2019s shown how he can turn prot\u00e9g\u00e9 against mentor, how he can weaponize a devoted underling to destroy his beloved boss. How once he can get a campaign insider talking, what flows is damning beyond expectations. The question is now whether Gates\u2019s testimony represents the culmination of a long and corrupt story, or the opening pages of a much more complicated tale."}
{"prompt": "At one point during an episode of the CW's mystery series Cult, one of the characters makes another the impassioned promise that \"There will be an answer!\" Given the show's intense love affair with metafiction, I wondered if the line might be a winking acknowledgement that it's only the latest in a long line of post-Lost series that revolves around a slowly unfolding puzzle, a subgenre that from its progenitor on has been long on teases and short on actual answers. I also thought to myself, they better give us that answer in season one because there's no way this thing's going to get picked up again. The end seems to have come sooner than I expected. Yesterday, the CW announced that its slot for the next three Fridays will be filled by reruns of The Carrie Diaries.\nCult's incredibly convoluted central conceit is that in the fictional Cult universe there is a show called Cult about a police officer on a mission to take down Billy Grimm, the charismatic leader of the highly unorthodox religious sect that she was raised in, and that it's spawned a", "baseline": "massive, intensely obsessive fan base with a radical wing that essentially worships Grimm as if he were a real-life spiritual leader and has begun to dabble in ritualized murder. Jeff, a journalist, has a mentally ill brother, Nate, who becomes consumed with solving the meta-show's puzzles and disappears under highly suspicious circumstances, leaving behind a crazy-looking trove of research indicating that the Cult cult's responsible. Skye is a production assistant on the meta-show who discovers the so-called True Believers by monitoring the online communities that have sprung up around the show and begins to suspect that its secretive, eccentric executive producer, Stephen Rae (who in a clever extra-meta twist is credited as executive producer of the real Cult), is actively encouraging and guiding them.\nCult had a lot going against it, starting with the fact that explaining the basic plot of the show to someone at a bar takes several minutes and a lot of air-quotes and diagrams, and even then is so complicated that by the time you're done the person you're explaining it to will most likely be totally uninterested in expending the brain power to actually watch it. And being a show on the CW, the cast basically looks like the cast of a CW show, just a little too pretty to be read as actual people, with the exception of Prison Break's Robert Knepper, who plays Grimm, and the continually great Aisha Hinds as the shady detective working to keep Jeff and Skye from discovering the nature of the True Believers.\nLost, ridiculously long and complex theories on What It All Means. It's the nature of modern fandom that we don't just passively consume entertainment anymore; we actively engage with it through remixes. Obsession has become the mainstream. The water-cooler chat about last night's episode has been supplanted by online communities of devotees who don't think it's at all weird that your life revolves around an entertainment property. And when there are people who get so deeply into TV shows and movies that they will, for instance, self-identify as giant alien cat-people, the idea of a group of diehard fans following the instructions of a fictional cult leader isn't so hard to believe.\nThe real-world Cult doesn't seem to have done much to inspire that kind of devotion. Its apparent cancelation hasn't caused much noise online, and a grassroots campaign to save it (another common feature of modern fandom) doesn't seem very likely. But it had some good ideas, and once you understand the metafictional setup, its central mystery is compelling enough to easily inspire some binge viewing on Hulu. As the geek-culture blog io9 suggests, there could still be a DVD set in the future, or a spot for it in the CW's summer lineup, where we could see how the rest of the season plays out. Which hopefully there will be, because as cheesy as the show could be, it managed to get its hooks in me. And I still want that answer.\nMiles Raymer is a writer based in New York City who has contributed to the Chicago Reader, Vice, Pitchfork, and others."}
